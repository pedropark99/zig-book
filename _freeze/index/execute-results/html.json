It explores the exciting world of Zig through small\nand simple projects (in a similar style to the famous \"Python Crash Course\" book from Eric Matthes).\nSome of these projects are: a Base64 encoder/decoder, a HTTP Server and an image filter.\n\nAs you work through the book, you will learn:\n\n- The syntax of the language, and how it compares to C, C++ and Rust.\n- Data structures, memory allocators, filesystem and I/O.\n- Optionals as a new paradigm to handle nullability.\n- How to test and debug a Zig application.\n- Errors as values, and how to handle them.\n- How to build C and Zig code with the build system that is embedded into the language.\n- Zig interoperability with C.\n- Parallelism with threads and SIMD.\n- And more.\n\n\n## About the author {.unnumbered}\n\nPedro Duarte Faria has a bachelor's degree in Economics from the Federal University of Ouro Preto - Brazil.\nCurrently, he is a Data Platform Engineer at [Blip](https://www.blip.ai/en/)[^blip], and\na Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark 3.0.\n\n[^blip]: <https://www.blip.ai/en/>\n\n\nThe author has more than 4 years of experience in the data industry, developing data products, pipelines,\nreports and analysis for research institutions and some of the largest companies in the\nBrazilian financial sector, such as the BMG Bank, Sodexo and Pan Bank.\n\nBut Pedro is also a passionate software developer who loves to learn and teach about programming.\nAlthough Pedro uses many different languages in his work, he is specialized in the R programming language, and have given several\nlectures and courses about it, inside graduate centers (such as PPEA-UFOP^[<https://ppea.ufop.br/>]),\nin addition to federal and state organizations (such as FJP-MG^[<http://fjp.mg.gov.br/>]).\n\n\nPersonal Website: <https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/>\n\nLinkedin: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-faria-a68140209/>\n\nMastodon: [\\@pedropark99\\@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@pedropark99)\n\nTwitter (X): [\\@PedroPark9](https://twitter.com/PedroPark9)\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\nCopyright © 2024 Pedro Duarte Faria.
