This is the initial page for the \"Open Access\" HTML version of the book \"Introduction to Zig: a project-based book\",\nwritten by [Pedro Duarte Faria](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/).\nThis is an open book that provides an introduction to the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/),\nwhich is a new general-purpose, and low-level language for building robust and optimal software.\n\n## About this book {.unnumbered}\n\nThis an open book, meaning that, it is open-source, and it will always be open\nfor anyone that wants to read it.
