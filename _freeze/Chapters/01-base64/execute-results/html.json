So, if you need, for any reason, to\nsend a binary file (like for example, a PDF, or an Excel file) as\nan attachment in your email, these binary files are normally\nconverted to base64, before they are included in the SMTP message.\nSo, the base64 encoding is largely used in these email systems to include\nbinary data into the SMTP message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## How the base64 algorithm work?\n\nBut how exactly does the algorithm behind the base64 encoding work? Let's discuss that. First, I will\nexplain the base64 scale, which is the 64-character scale that is the basis for\nthe base64 encoding system.\n\nAfter that, I explain the algorithm behind a base64 encoder, which is the part of the algorithm that is responsible for encoding messages\ninto the base64 encoding system. Then, after that, I explain the algorithm behind a base64 decoder, which is\nthe part of the algorithm that is responsible for translating base64 messages back into their original meaning.\n\nIf you are unsure about the differences between an \"encoder\" and a \"decoder\",\ntake a look at @sec-encode-vs-decode.\n\n\n### The base64 scale {#sec-base64-scale}\n\nThe base64 encoding system is based on a scale that goes from 0 to 63 (hence the name).\nEach index in this scale is represented by a character (it's a scale of 64 characters).\nSo, in order to convert some binary data, to the base64 encoding, we need to convert each binary number to the corresponding\ncharacter in this \"scale of 64 characters\".\n\nThe base64 scale starts with all ASCII uppercase letters (A to Z) which represents\nthe first 25 indexes in this scale (0 to 25). After that, we have all ASCII lowercase letters\n(a to z), which represents the range 26 to 51 in the scale. After that, we\nhave the one digit numbers (0 to 9), which represents the indexes from 52 to 61 in the scale.\nFinally, the last two indexes in the scale (62 and 63) are represented by the characters `+` and `/`,\nrespectively.\n\nThese are the 64 characters that compose the base64 scale. The equal sign character (`=`) is not part of the scale itself,\nbut it is a special character in the base64 encoding system. This character is used solely as a suffix, to mark the end of the character sequence,\nor, to mark the end of meaningful characters in the sequence.\n\nThe bullet points below summarises the base64 scale:\n\n- range 0 to 25 is represented by: ASCII uppercase letters `-> [A-Z]`;\n- range 26 to 51 is represented by: ASCII lowercase letters `-> [a-z]`;\n- range 52 to 61 is represented by: one digit numbers `-> [0-9]`;\n- index 62 and 63 are represented by the characters `+` and `/`, respectively;\n- the character `=` represents the end of meaningful characters in the sequence;\n\n\n\n\n### Creating the scale as a lookup table {#sec-base64-table}\n\nThe best way to represent this scale in code, is to represent it as a *lookup table*.\nLookup tables are a classic strategy in computer science to speed up calculations. The basic idea\nis to replace a runtime calculation (which can take a long time to be done) with a basic array indexing\noperation.\n\nInstead of calculating the results everytime you need them, you calculate all possible results at once, and then, you store them in an array\n(which behaves like a \"table\"). Then, every time you need to use one of the characters in the base64 scale, instead of\nusing many resources to calculate the exact character to be used, you simply retrieve this character\nfrom the array where you stored all the possible characters in the base64 scale.\nWe retrieve the character that we need directly from memory.\n\nWe can start building a Zig struct to store our base64 decoder/encoder logic.\nWe start with the `Base64` struct below. For now, we only have one single data member in this\nstruct, i.e., the member `_table`, which represents our lookup table. We also have an `init()` method,\nto create a new instance of a `Base64` object, and, a `_char_at()` method, which is a\n\"get character at index $x$\" type of function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst Base64 = struct {\n    _table: *const [64]u8,\n\n    pub fn init() Base64 {\n        const upper = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\";\n        const lower = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\n        const numbers_symb = \"0123456789+/\";\n        return Base64{\n            ._table = upper ++ lower ++ numbers_symb,\n        };\n    }\n\n    pub fn _char_at(self: Base64, index: usize) u8 {\n        return self._table[index];\n    }\n};\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIn other words, the `_char_at()` method is responsible for getting the character in the lookup\ntable (i.e., the `_table` struct data member) that corresponds to a particular index in the\n\"base64 scale\". So, in the example below, we know that the character that corresponds to the\nindex 28 in the \"base64 scale\" is the character \"c\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst base64 = Base64.init();\ntry stdout.print(\n    \"Character at index 28: {c}\\n\",\n    .{base64._char_at(28)}\n);\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nCharacter at index 28: c\n```\n\n\n\n### A base64 encoder {#sec-base64-encoder-algo}\n\nThe algorithm behind a base64 encoder usually works on a window of 3 bytes. Because each byte has\n8 bits, so, 3 bytes forms a set of $8 \\times 3 = 24$ bits. This is desirable for the base64 algorithm, because\n24 bits is divisible by 6, which forms $24 / 6 = 4$ groups of 6 bits each.\n\nTherefore, the base64 algorithm works by converting 3 bytes at a time\ninto 4 characters from the base64 scale. It keeps iterating through the input string,\n3 bytes at a time, and converting them into the base64 scale, producing 4 characters\nper iteration. It keeps iterating, and producing these \"new characters\"\nuntil it hits the end of the input string.\n\nNow you may think, what if you have a particular string that has a number of bytes\nthat is not divisible by 3 - what happens? For example, if you have a string\nthat contains only two characters/bytes, such as \"Hi\". How would the algorithm\nbehave in such situation? You find the answer in @fig-base64-algo1.\nYou can see in @fig-base64-algo1 that the string \"Hi\", when converted to base64,\nbecomes the string \"SGk=\":\n\n![The logic behind a base64 encoder](./../Figures/base64-encoder-flow.png){#fig-base64-algo1}\n\nTaking the string \"Hi\" as an example, we have 2 bytes, or, 16 bits in total. So, we lack a full byte (8 bits)\nto complete the window of 24 bits that the base64 algorithm likes to work on. The first thing that\nthe algorithm does, is to check how to divide the input bytes into groups of 6 bits.\n\nIf the algorithm notices that there is a group of 6 bits that it's not complete, meaning that, this group contains $nbits$, where $0 < nbits < 6$,\nthe algorithm simply adds extra zeros in this group to fill the space that it needs.\nThat is why in @fig-base64-algo1, in the third group after the 6-bit transformation,\n2 extra zeros were added to fill the gap.\n\nWhen we have a 6-bit group that is not completely full, like the third group, extra zeros\nare added to fill the gap. But what about when an entire 6-bit group is empty, or, it\nsimply doesn't exist? This is the case of the fourth 6-bit group exposed at\n@fig-base64-algo1.\n\nThis fourth group is necessary, because the algorithm works on 4 groups of 6 bits.\nBut the input string does not have enough bytes to create a fourth 6-bit group.\nEvery time this happens, where an entire group of 6 bits is empty,\nthis group becomes a \"padding group\". Every \"padding group\" is mapped to\nthe character `=` (equal sign), which represents \"null\", or, the end\nof meaningful characters in the sequence. Hence, everytime that the algorithm produces a\n\"padding group\", this group is automatically mapped to `=`.\n\nAs another example, if you give the string \"0\" as input to a base64 encoder, this string is\ntranslated into the base64 sequence \"MA==\".\nThe character \"0\" is, in binary, the sequence `00110000`[^zero-note]. So, with the 6-bit transformation\nexposed in @fig-base64-algo1, this single character would produce these two 6-bit groups: `001100`, `000000`.\nThe remaining two 6-bit groups become \"padding groups\". That is why the last\ntwo characters in the output sequence (MA==) are `==`.\n\n\n[^zero-note]: Notice that, the character \"0\" is different than the actual number 0, which is simply zero in binary.\n\n### A base64 decoder {#sec-base64-decoder-algo}\n\nThe algorithm behind a base64 decoder is essentially the inverse process of a base64 encoder.\nA base64 decoder needs to translate base64 messages back into their original meaning,\ni.e., into the original sequence of binary data.\n\nA base64 decoder usually works on a window of 4 bytes. Because it wants to convert these 4 bytes\nback into the original sequence of 3 bytes, that was converted into 4 groups of 6 bits by the\nbase64 encoder. Remember, in a base64 decoder we are essentially reverting the process made\nby the base64 encoder.\n\nEach byte in the input string (the base64 encoded string) normally contributes to re-create\ntwo different bytes in the output (the original binary data).\nIn other words, each byte that comes out of a base64 decoder is created by transforming merging two different\nbytes in the input together. You can visualize this relationship in @fig-base64-algo2:\n\n![The logic behind a base64 decoder](./../Figures/base64-decoder-flow.png){#fig-base64-algo2}\n\nThe exact transformations, or, the exact steps applied to each byte from the input to transform them\ninto the bytes of the output, are a bit tricky to visualize in a figure like this. Because of that, I have\nsummarized these transformations as \"Some bit shifting and additions ...\" in the figure. These transformations\nwill be described in depth later.\n\nBesides that, if you look again in @fig-base64-algo2, you will notice that the character `=` was completely\nignored by the algorithm. Remember, this is just a special character that marks the end of meaningful characters\nin the base64 sequence. So, every `=` character in a base64 encoded sequence should be ignored by a base64 decoder.\n\n\n## Difference between encode and decode {#sec-encode-vs-decode}\n\nIf you don't have any previous experience with base64, you might not understand the differences\nbetween \"encode\" and \"decode\". Essentially, the terms \"encode\" and \"decode\" here\nhave the exact same meaning as they have in the field of encryption (i.e., they mean the same thing as \"encode\" and \"decode\" in hashing\nalgorithms, like the MD5 algorithm).\n\nThus, \"encode\" means that we want to encode, or, in other words, we want to translate some message into\nthe base64 encoding system. We want to produce the sequence of base64 characters that represent this\noriginal message in the base64 encoding system.\n\nIn contrast, \"decode\" represents the inverse process.\nWe want to decode, or, in other words, translate a base64 message back to its original content.\nSo, in this process we get a sequence of base64 characters as input, and produce as output,\nthe binary data that is represented by this sequence of base64 characters.\n\nAny base64 library is normally composed of these two parts: 1) the encoder, which is a function that encodes\n(i.e., it converts) any sequence of binary data into a sequence of base64 characters; 2) the decoder, which is a function\nthat converts a sequence of base64 characters back into the original sequence of binary data.\n\n\n\n## Calculating the size of the output {#sec-base64-length-out}\n\nOne task that we need to do is to calculate how much space we need to reserve for the\noutput, both of the encoder and decoder. This is simple math, and can be done easily in Zig\nbecause every array has its length (its number of elements) easily accesible by consulting\nthe `.len` property of the array.\n\nFor the encoder, the logic is the following: for each 3 bytes that we find in the input,\n4 new bytes are created in the output. So, we take the number of bytes in the input, divide it\nby 3, use a ceiling function, then, we multiply the result by 4. That way, we get the total\nnumber of bytes that will be produced by the encoder in its output.\n\nThe `_calc_encode_length()` function below encapsulates this logic.\nInside this function, we take the length of the input array,\nwe divide it by 3, and apply a ceil operation over the result by using the\n`divCeil()` function from the Zig Standard Library. Lastly, we multiply\nthe end result by 4 to get the answer we need.\n\nAlso, you might have notice that, if the input length is less than 3 bytes, then, the output length of the encoder is\nalways 4 bytes. This is the case for every input with less than 3 bytes, because, as I described in @sec-base64-encoder-algo,\nthe algorithm always produces enough \"padding-groups\" in the end result, to complete the 4 bytes window.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nfn _calc_encode_length(input: []const u8) !usize {\n    if (input.len < 3) {\n        return 4;\n    }\n    const n_groups: usize = try std.math.divCeil(\n        usize, input.len, 3\n    );\n    return n_groups * 4;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, the logic to calculate the length of the output from the decoder is a little bit more complicated. But, it is basically\njust the inverse logic that we've used for the encoder: for each 4 bytes in the input, 3 bytes\nwill be produced in the output of the decoder. However, this time we need to\ntake the `=` character into account, which is always ignored by the decoder, as we described in @sec-base64-decoder-algo, and,\nin @fig-base64-algo2.\n\nIn essence, we take the length of the input and divide it by 4, then we apply a floor function on the result, then\nwe multiply the result by 3, and then, we subtract from the result how much times the character `=` is found\nin the input.\n\nThe function `_calc_decode_length()` exposed below summarizes this logic that we described. It's similar\nto the function `_calc_encode_length()`. Notice that the division part is twisted. Also notice that this time, we apply\na floor operation over the output of the division, by using the `divFloor()`\nfunction (instead of a ceiling operation with `divCeil()`).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nfn _calc_decode_length(input: []const u8) !usize {\n    if (input.len < 4) {\n        return 3;\n    }\n\n    const n_groups: usize = try std.math.divFloor(\n        usize, input.len, 4\n    );\n    var multiple_groups: usize = n_groups * 3;\n    var i: usize = input.len - 1;\n    while (i > 0) : (i -= 1) {\n        if (input[i] == '=') {\n            multiple_groups -= 1;\n        } else {\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return multiple_groups;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Building the encoder logic {#sec-encoder-logic}\n\nIn this section, we can start building the logic behind the `encode()` function, which\nwill be responsible for encoding messages into the base64 encoding system.\nIf you are an anxious person, and you want to see now the full source code of the implementation\nfor this base64 encoder/decoder, you can find it at the `ZigExamples` folder in the official repository of\nthis book[^zig-base64-algo].\n\n[^zig-base64-algo]: <https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/blob/main/ZigExamples/base64/base64_basic.zig>.\n\n\n\n### The 6-bit transformation {#sec-6bit-transf}\n\nThe 6-bit transformation presented in @fig-base64-algo1 is the core part of the base64 encoder algorithm.\nBy understanding how this transformation is made in code, the rest of the algorithm becomes much simpler\nto comprehend.\n\nIn essence, this 6-bit transformation is made with the help of bitwise operators.\nBitwise operators are essential to any type of low-level operation that is done at the bit-level. For the specific case of the base64 algorithm,\nthe operators *bit shift to the left* (`<<`), *bit shift to the right* (`>>`), and the *bitwise and* (`&`) are used. They\nare the core solution for the 6-bit transformation.\n\nThere are 3 different scenarios that we need to take into account in this transformation. First, is the perfect scenario,\nwhere we have the perfect window of 3 bytes to work on. Second, we have the scenario where we have a window of only\ntwo bytes to work with. And last, we have the scenario where we have a window of one single byte.\n\nIn each of these 3 scenarios, the 6-bit transformation works a bit differently. To make the explanation\neasier, I will use the variable `output` to refer to the bytes in the output of the base64 encoder,\nand the variable `input` to refer to the bytes in the input of the encoder.\n\n\nSo, if you have the perfect window of 3 bytes, these are steps for the 6-bit transformation:\n\n1. `output[0]` is produced by moving the bits from `input[0]` two positions to the right.\n1. `output[1]` is produced by summing two components. First, take the last two bits from `input[0]`, then, move them four positions to the left. Second, move the bits from `input[1]` four positions to the right. Sum these two components.\n1. `output[2]` is produced by summing two components. First, take the last four bits from `input[1]`, then, move them two positions to the left. Second, move the bits from `input[2]` six positions to the right. Sum these two components.\n1. `output[3]` is produced by taking the last six bits from `input[2]`.\n\n\nThis is the perfect scenario, where we have a full window of 3 bytes to work on.\nJust to make things as clear as possible, the @fig-encoder-bitshift demonstrates visually how\nthe step 2 mentioned above works. So the 2nd byte in the `output` of the encoder, is made by taking the 1st byte (dark purple)\nand the 2nd byte (orange) from the input. You can see that, at the end of the process, we get a new\nbyte that contains the last 2 bits from the 1st byte in the `input`, and the first 4 bits\nfrom the 2nd byte in the `input`.\n\n![How the 2nd byte in the output of the encoder is produced from the 1st byte (dark purple) and the 2nd byte (orange) of the input.](../Figures/base64-encoder-bit-shift.png){#fig-encoder-bitshift}\n\nOn the other hand, we must be prepared for the instances where we do not have the perfect window of 3 bytes.\nIf you have a window of 2 bytes, then, the steps 3 and 4, which produces the bytes `output[2]` and `output[3]`, change a little bit,\nand they become:\n\n- `output[2]` is produced by taking the last 4 bits from `input[1]`, then, move them two positions to the left.\n- `output[3]` is the character `'='`.\n\n\nFinally, if you have a window of a single byte, then, the steps 2 to 4, which produces the bytes `output[1]`, `output[2]` and `output[3]` change,\nbecoming:\n\n- `output[1]` is produced by taking the last two bits from `input[0]`, then, move them four positions to the left.\n- `output[2]` and `output[3]` are the character `=`.\n\n\nIf these bullet points were a bit confusing for you, you may find the @tbl-transf-6bit more intuitive.\nThis table unifies all this logic into a simple table. Notice that\nthis table also provides the exact expression in Zig that creates the corresponding\nbyte in the output.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-transf-6bit}\n\n| Number of bytes in the window | Byte index in the output | In code                                    |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 3                             | 0                        | input[0] >> 2                              |\n| 3                             | 1                        | ((input[0] & 0x03) << 4) + (input[1] >> 4) |\n| 3                             | 2                        | ((input[1] & 0x0f) << 2) + (input[2] >> 6) |\n| 3                             | 3                        | input[2] & 0x3f                            |\n| 2                             | 0                        | input[0] >> 2                              |\n| 2                             | 1                        | ((input[0] & 0x03) << 4) + (input[1] >> 4) |\n| 2                             | 2                        | ((input[1] & 0x0f) << 2)                   |\n| 2                             | 3                        | '='                                        |\n| 1                             | 0                        | input[0] >> 2                              |\n| 1                             | 1                        | ((input[0] & 0x03) << 4)                   |\n| 1                             | 2                        | '='                                        |\n| 1                             | 3                        | '='                                        |\n\n: How the 6-bit transformation translates into code in different window settings.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Bit-shifting in Zig\n\nBit-shifting in Zig works similarly to bit-shifting in C.\nAll bitwise operators that exist in C are available in Zig.\nHere, in the base64 encoder algorithm, they are essential\nto produce the result we want.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with these operators, they are\noperators that operates at the bit-level of your values.\nThis means that these operators takes the bits that form the value\nyou have, and change them in some way. This ultimately also changes\nthe value itself, because the binary representation of this value\nchanges.\n\nWe have already seen in @fig-encoder-bitshift the effect produced by a bit-shift.\nBut let's use the first byte in the output of the base64 encoder as another example of what\nbit-shifting means. This is the easiest byte of the 4 bytes in the output\nto build. Because we only need to move the bits from the first byte in the input two positions to the right,\nwith the *bit shift to the right* (`>>`) operator.\n\nIf we take the string \"Hi\" that we used in @fig-base64-algo1 as an example, the first byte in\nthis string is \"H\", which is the sequence `01001000` in binary.\nIf we move the bits of this byte, two places to the right, we get the sequence `00010010` as result.\nThis binary sequence is the value `18` in decimal, and also, the value `0x12` in hexadecimal.\nNotice that the first 6 bits of \"H\" were moved to the end of the byte.\nWith this operation, we get the first byte of the output.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\npub fn main() !void {\n    const input = \"Hi\";\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{input[0] >> 2});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n18\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you recall @fig-base64-algo1, the first byte present in the output should\nbe equivalent to the 6-bit group `010010`. Although being visually different, the\nsequences `010010` and `00010010` are semantically equal. They mean the same thing.\nThey both represent the number 18 in decimal, and the value `0x12` in hexadecimal.\n\nSo, don't take the \"6-bit group\" factor so seriously. We do not need necessarily to\nget a 6-bit sequence as result. As long as the meaning of the 8-bit sequence we get is the same\nof the 6-bit sequence, we are in the clear.\n\n\n\n### Selecting specific bits with the `&` operator\n\nIf you comeback to @sec-6bit-transf, you will see that, in order to produce\nthe second and third bytes in the output, we need to select specific\nbits from the first and second bytes in the input string. But how\ncan we do that? The answer relies on the *bitwise and* (`&`) operator.\n\nThe @fig-encoder-bitshift already showed you what effect this `&` operator\nproduces in the bits of its operands. But let's make a clear description of it.\n\nIn summary, the `&` operator performs a logical conjunction operation\nbetween the bits of its operands. In more details, the operator `&`\ncompares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand.\nIf both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1.\nOtherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0 [@microsoftbitwiseand].\n\nSo, if we apply this operator to the binary sequences `1000100` and `00001101`\nthe result of this operation is the binary sequence `00000100`. Because only\nat the sixth position in both binary sequences we had a 1 value. So any\nposition where we do not have both binary sequences setted to 1, we get\na 0 bit in the resulting binary sequence.\n\nWe lose information about the original bit values\nfrom both sequences in this case. Because we no longer know\nif this 0 bit in the resulting binary sequence was produced by\ncombining 0 with 0, or 1 with 0, or 0 with 1.\n\nAs an example, suppose you have the binary sequence `10010111`, which is the number 151 in decimal. How\ncan we get a new binary sequence which contains only the third and\nfourth bits of this sequence?\n\nWe just need to combine this sequence with `00110000` (is `0x30` in hexadecimal) using the `&` operator.\nNotice that only the third and fourth positions in this binary sequence is setted to 1. As a consequence, only the\nthird and fourth values of both binary sequences are potentially preserved in the output. All the remaining positions\nare setted to zero in the output sequence, which is `00010000` (is the number 16 in decimal).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const bits = 0b10010111;\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{bits & 0b00110000});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Allocating space for the output\n\nAs I described in @sec-stack, to store an object in the stack,\nthis object needs to have a known and fixed length at compile-time. This is an important\nlimitation for our base64 encoder/decoder case. Because the size of\nthe output (from both the encoder and decoder) depends\ndirectly on the size of the input.\n\nHaving this in mind, we cannot know at compile time which is\nthe size of the output for both the encoder and decoder.\nSo, if we can't know the size of the output at compile time,\nthis means that we cannot store the output for both the encoder\nand decoder in the stack.\n\nConsequently, we need to store this output on the heap,\nand, as I commented in @sec-heap, we can only\nstore objects in the heap by using allocator objects.\nSo, one of the arguments to both the `encode()` and `decode()`\nfunctions, needs to be an allocator object, because\nwe know for sure that, at some point inside the body of these\nfunctions, we need to allocate space on the heap to\nstore the output of these functions.\n\nThat is why, both the `encode()` and `decode()` functions that I\npresent in this book, have an argument called `allocator`,\nwhich receives a allocator object as input, identified by\nthe type `std.mem.Allocator` from the Zig Standard Library.\n\n\n\n### Writing the `encode()` function\n\nNow that we have a basic understanding on how the bitwise operators work, and how\nexactly they help us to achieve the result we want to achieve. We can now encapsulate\nall the logic that we have described in @fig-base64-algo1 and @tbl-transf-6bit into a nice\nfunction that we can add to our `Base64` struct definition, that we started in @sec-base64-table.\n\nYou can find the `encode()` function below. Notice that the first argument of this function,\nis the `Base64` struct itself. Therefore, this argument clearly signals\nthat this function is a method from the `Base64` struct.\n\nBecause the `encode()` function itself is fairly long,\nI intentionally omitted the `Base64` struct definition in this source code,\njust for brevity reasons. So, just remember that this function is a public function (or a public method) from the\n`Base64` struct.\n\nFurthermore, this `encode()` function has two other arguments:\n\n1. `input` is the input sequence of characters that you want to encode in base64;\n1. `allocator` is an allocator object to use in the necessary memory allocations.\n\nI described everything you need to know about allocator objects in @sec-allocators.\nSo, if you are not familiar with them, I highly recommend you to comeback to\nthat section, and read it.\nBy looking at the `encode()` function, you will see that we use this\nallocator object to allocate enough memory to store the output of\nthe encoding process.\n\nThe main for loop in the function is responsible for iterating through the entire input string.\nIn every iteration, we use a `count` variable to count how many iterations we had at the\nmoment. When `count` reaches 3, then, we try to encode the 3 characters (or bytes) that we have accumulated\nin the temporary buffer object (`buf`).\n\nAfter encoding these 3 characters and storing the result in the `output` variable, we reset\nthe `count` variable to zero, and start to count again on the next iteration of the loop.\nIf the loop hits the end of the string, and, the `count` variable is less than 3, then, it means that\nthe temporary buffer contains the last 1 or 2 bytes from the input.\nThat is why we have two `if` statements after the for loop. To deal which each possible case.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\npub fn encode(self: Base64,\n              allocator: std.mem.Allocator,\n              input: []const u8) ![]u8 {\n\n    if (input.len == 0) {\n        return \"\";\n    }\n\n    const n_out = try _calc_encode_length(input);\n    var out = try allocator.alloc(u8, n_out);\n    var buf = [3]u8{ 0, 0, 0 };\n    var count: u8 = 0;\n    var iout: u64 = 0;\n\n    for (input, 0..) |_, i| {\n        buf[count] = input[i];\n        count += 1;\n        if (count == 3) {\n            out[iout] = self._char_at(buf[0] >> 2);\n            out[iout + 1] = self._char_at(\n                ((buf[0] & 0x03) << 4) + (buf[1] >> 4)\n            );\n            out[iout + 2] = self._char_at(\n                ((buf[1] & 0x0f) << 2) + (buf[2] >> 6)\n            );\n            out[iout + 3] = self._char_at(buf[2] & 0x3f);\n            iout += 4;\n            count = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (count == 1) {\n        out[iout] = self._char_at(buf[0] >> 2);\n        out[iout + 1] = self._char_at(\n            (buf[0] & 0x03) << 4\n        );\n        out[iout + 2] = '=';\n        out[iout + 3] = '=';\n    }\n\n    if (count == 2) {\n        out[iout] = self._char_at(buf[0] >> 2);\n        out[iout + 1] = self._char_at(\n            ((buf[0] & 0x03) << 4) + (buf[1] >> 4)\n        );\n        out[iout + 2] = self._char_at(\n            (buf[1] & 0x0f) << 2\n        );\n        out[iout + 3] = '=';\n        iout += 4;\n    }\n\n    return out;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Building the decoder logic {#sec-decoder-logic}\n\nNow, we can focus on writing the base64 decoder logic. Remember from @fig-base64-algo2 that,\na base64 decoder does the inverse process of an encoder. So, all we need to do, is to\nwrite a `decode()` function that performs the inverse process that I exposed in @sec-encoder-logic.\n\n\n### Mapping base64 characters to their indexes {#sec-map-base64-index}\n\nOne thing that we need to do, in order to decode a base64-encoded message, is to calculate\nthe index in the base64 scale of every base64 character that we encounter in the decoder input.\n\nIn other words, the decoder receives as input, a sequence of base64 characters. We need\nto translate this sequence of characters into a sequence of indexes. These indexes\nare the index of each character in the base64 scale. This way, we get the value/byte\nthat was calculated in the 6-bit transformation step of the encoder process.\n\nThere are probably better/faster ways to calculate this, especially using a \"divide and conquer\"\ntype of strategy. But for now, I am satisfied with a simple and \"brute force\" type of strategy.\nThe `_char_index()` function below contains this strategy.\n\nWe are essentially looping through the *lookup table* with the base64 scale,\nand comparing the character we got with each character in the base64 scale.\nIf these characters match, then, we return the index of this character in the\nbase64 scale as the result.\n\nNotice that, if the input character is `'='`, the function returns the index 64, which is\n\"out of range\" in the scale. But, as I described in @sec-base64-scale,\nthe character `'='` does not belong to the base64 scale itself.\nIt's a special and meaningless character in base64.\n\nAlso notice that this `_char_index()` function is a method from our `Base64` struct,\nbecause of the `self` argument. Again, I have omitted the `Base64` struct definition in this example\nfor brevity reasons.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nfn _char_index(self: Base64, char: u8) u8 {\n    if (char == '=')\n        return 64;\n    var index: u8 = 0;\n    for (0..63) |i| {\n        if (self._char_at(i) == char)\n            break;\n        index += 1;\n    }\n\n    return index;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### The 6-bit transformation\n\nOnce again, the core part of the algorithm is the 6-bit transformation.\nIf we understand the necessary steps to perform this transformation, the rest\nof the algorithm becomes much easier.\n\nFirst of all, before we actually go to the 6-bit transformation,\nwe need to make sure that we use `_char_index()` to convert the sequence of base64 characters\ninto a sequence of indexes. So the snippet below is important for the job that will be done.\nThe result of `_char_index()` is stored in a temporary buffer, and this temporary buffer\nis what we are going to use in the 6-bit transformation, instead of the actual `input` object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nfor (0..input.len) |i| {\n    buf[i] = self._char_index(input[i]);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, instead of producing 4 bytes (or 4 characters) as output per each window of 3 characters in the input,\na base64 decoder produces 3 bytes (or 3 characters) as output per each window of 4 characters in the input.\nOnce again, is the inverse process.\n\nSo, the steps to produce the 3 bytes in the output are:\n\n1. `output[0]` is produced by summing two components. First, move the bits from `buf[0]` two positions to the left. Second, move the bits from `buf[1]` 4 positions to the right. Then, sum these two components.\n1. `output[1]` is produced by summing two components. First, move the bits from `buf[1]` four positions to the left. Second, move the bits from `buf[2]` 2 positions to the right. Then, sum these two components.\n1. `output[2]` is produced by summing two components. First, move the bits from `buf[2]` six positions to the left. Then, you sum the result with `buf[3]`.\n\n\nBefore we continue, let's try to visualize how these transformations make the original bytes that we had\nbefore the encoding process. First, think back to the 6-bit transformation performed by the encoder exposed in @sec-encoder-logic.\nThe first byte in the output of the encoder is produced by moving the bits in the first byte of the input two positions to the right.\n\nIf for example the first byte in the input of the encoder was the sequence `ABCDEFGH`, then, the first byte in the output of the encoder would be\n`00ABCDEF` (this sequence would be the first byte in the input of the decoder). Now, if the second byte in the input of the encoder was the sequence\n`IJKLMNOP`, then, the second byte in the encoder output would be `00GHIJKL` (as we demonstrated in @fig-encoder-bitshift).\n\nHence, if the sequences `00ABCDEF` and `00GHIJKL` are the first and second bytes, respectively, in the input of the decoder, the\n@fig-decoder-bitshift demonstrates visually how these two bytes are transformed into the first byte of the output of the decoder.\nNotice that the output byte is the sequence `ABCDEFGH`, which is the original byte from the input of the encoder.\n\n![How the 1st byte in the decoder output is produced from the 1st byte (dark purple) and the 2nd byte (orange) of the input](../Figures/base64-decoder-bit-shift.png){#fig-decoder-bitshift}\n\nThe @tbl-6bit-decode presents how the three steps described earlier translate into Zig code:\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-6bit-decode}\n\n| Byte index in the output | In code                       |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 0                        | (buf[0] << 2) + (buf[1] >> 4) |\n| 1                        | (buf[1] << 4) + (buf[2] >> 2) |\n| 2                        | (buf[2] << 6) + buf[3]        |\n\n: The necessary steps for the 6-transformation in the decode process.\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Writing the `decode()` function\n\nThe `decode()` function below contains the entire decoding process.\nWe first calculate the size of the output, with\n`_calc_decode_length()`, then, we allocate enough memory for this output with\nthe allocator object.\n\nThree temporary variables are created: 1) `count`, to hold the window count\nin each iteration of the for loop; 2) `iout`, to hold the current index in the output;\n3) `buf`, which is the temporary buffer that holds the base64 indexes to be\nconverted through the 6-bit transformation.\n\nThen, in each iteration of the for loop we fill the temporary buffer with the current\nwindow of bytes. When `count` hits the number 4, then, we have a full window of\nindexes in `buf` to be converted, and then, we apply the 6-bit transformation\nover the temporary buffer.\n\nNotice that we check if the indexes 2 and 3 in the temporary buffer are the number 64, which, if you recall\nfrom @sec-map-base64-index, is when the `_calc_index()` function receives a `'='` character\nas input. So, if these indexes are equal to the number 64, the `decode()` function knows\nthat it can simply ignore these indexes. They are not converted because, as I described before,\nthe character `'='` has no meaning, despite being the end of meaningful characters in the sequence.\nSo we can safely ignore them when they appear in the sequence.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nfn decode(self: Base64,\n          allocator: std.mem.Allocator,\n          input: []const u8) ![]u8 {\n\n    if (input.len == 0) {\n        return \"\";\n    }\n    const n_output = try _calc_decode_length(input);\n    var output = try allocator.alloc(u8, n_output);\n    var count: u8 = 0;\n    var iout: u64 = 0;\n    var buf = [4]u8{ 0, 0, 0, 0 };\n\n    for (0..input.len) |i| {\n        buf[count] = self._char_index(input[i]);\n        count += 1;\n        if (count == 4) {\n            output[iout] = (buf[0] << 2) + (buf[1] >> 4);\n            if (buf[2] != 64) {\n                output[iout + 1] = (buf[1] << 4) + (buf[2] >> 2);\n            }\n            if (buf[3] != 64) {\n                output[iout + 2] = (buf[2] << 6) + buf[3];\n            }\n            iout += 3;\n            count = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return output;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## The end result\n\nNow that we have both `decode()` and `encode()` implemented.
