This time, we are going\nto implement a basic HTTP Server from scratch.\n\nThe Zig Standard Library already have a HTTP Server\nimplemented, which is available at `std.http.Server`.\nBut again, our objective here in this chapter, is to implement\nit **from scratch**. So we can't use this server object available\nfrom the Zig Standard Library.\n\n## What is a HTTP Server?\n\nFirst of all, what is a HTTP Server?\nA HTTP server, as any other type of server, is essentially\na program that runs indefinetly, on a infinite loop, waiting for incoming connections\nfrom clients. Once the server receives an incoming connection, it will\naccept this connection, and it will send messages back-and-forth to the client\nthrough this connection.\n\nBut the messages that are transmitted inside this connection are in a\nspecific format. They are HTTP messages\n(i.e. messages that uses the HTTP Protocol specification).\nThe HTTP Protocol is the backbone of the modern web.\nThe world wide web as we know it today, would not exist without the \nHTTP Protocol.\n\nSo, Web servers (which is just a fancy name to\nHTTP Servers) are servers that exchange HTTP messages with clients.\nAnd these HTTP servers and the HTTP Protocol specification\nare simply essential to the operation of the internet of today.\n\nThat is the whole picture of the process.\nAgain, we have two subjects involved here, a server (which is\na program that is running indefinetly, waiting for connections),\nand a client (which is someone that wants to connect to\nand exchange HTTP messages with the server).\n\nYou may find the material about the [HTTP Protocol available at the Mozilla MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)[^mdn-http]\n, a great resource for you to also look at. It gives you a great overview on how\nHTTP works, and what role the server plays in this matter.\n\n[^mdn-http]: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview>.\n\n## How a HTTP Server works? {#sec-how-http-works}\n\nImagine a HTTP Server as if it were the receptionist of a large hotel. In a hotel,\nyou have a reception, and inside that reception there is a receptionist\nwaiting for customers to arrive. A HTTP Server is essentially a receptionist\nthat is indefinetly waiting for new customers (or, in the context of HTTP, new clients)\nto arrive in the hotel.\n\nWhen a customer arrives at the hotel, \nthat customer starts a conversation with the\nreceptionist. He tells the receptionist how many days he wants to stay at the hotel.\nThen, the receptionist search for an available apartment. If there is an available apartment\nat the moment, the customer pays the hotel fees, then, he gets the keys to the apartment,\nand then, he goes to the apartment to rest.\n\nAfter this entire process of dealing with the customer (searching for available rooms, receiving payment, handing over the keys),\nthe receptionist goes back to what he was doing earlier, which is to wait.\nWait for new customers to arrive.\n\nThat is, in a nutshell, what a HTTP Server do. It waits for clients to connect to the\nserver. When a client attempts to connect to the server, the server accepts this connection,\nand it starts to exchange messages with the client through this connection.\nThe first message that happens inside this connection is always a message from the client\nto the server. This message is called the *HTTP Request*.\n\nThis HTTP Request is a HTTP message that contains what\nthe client wants from the server. Is literally a request. The client\nthat connected to the server is asking this server to do something for him.\n\nThere are different \"types of request\" that any client can do to a HTTP Server.\nBut the most basic type of request, is when a client ask to the\nHTTP Server to serve (i.e. to send) some specific web page (which is a HTML file) to him.\nWhen you type `google.com` in your web browser, you are essentially sending a HTTP Request to Google's\nHTTP servers, which asks these servers to send the Google webpage to you.\n\nNonetheless, when the server reiceves this first message, the *HTTP Request*, it\nanalyzes this request, to understand: who the client is? what he wants the server to do?\nthis client provided all the necessary information to perform the action that he\nasked? Etc.\n\nOnce the server understands what the client wants, he simply perform the action\nthat was requested, and, to finish the whole process, the server sends back\na HTTP message to the client, informing if the action performed was succesful or not,\nand, at last, the server ends (or closes) the connection with the client.\n\nThis last HTTP message sent from the server to the client, is called the *HTTP Response*.\nBecause the server is responding to the action that was requested by the client.\nThe main objective of this response message is let the client knows if the\naction requested was succesful or not, before the server closes the connection.\n\n\n## How a HTTP server is normally implemented? {#sec-http-how-impl}\n\nLet's use the C language as an example. There are many materials\nteaching how to write a simple HTTP server in C code, like @jeffrey_http,\nor @nipun_http, or @eric_http.\nHaving this in mind, I will not show C code examples here, because you\ncan find them on the internet.\nBut I will describe the theory behind the necessary steps to perform in the C code.\n\n\nIn essence, we normally implement a HTTP server in C using WebSocket technology,\nwhich involves the following steps:\n\n1. Create a socket object.\n1. Bind a name (or more specifically, an address) to this socket object.\n1. Make this socket object to start listening and waiting for incoming connections.\n1. When a connection arrive, we accept this connection, and we exchange the HTTP messages (HTTP Request and HTTP Response).\n1. Then, we simply close this connection.\n\n\nA socket object (which uses the WebSocket technology) is essentially a channel of communication.\nYou are creating a channel where people can send messages to.\nWhen you create a socket object, this object is not binded to any particular\naddress. This means that with this object you have a representation of a channel of communication\nin your hands. But this channel is not currently available, or, it is not currently accessible,\nbecause it do not have a known address where you can find it.\n\nThat is what the \"bind\" operation do. It binds a name (or more specifically, an address) to\nthis socket object, or, this channel of communication, so that it becomes available,\nor, accessible through this address. While the \"listen\" operation makes the socket object to\nlisten for incoming connections in this address. In other words, the \"listen\" operation\nmakes the socket to wait for incoming connections.\n\nNow, when a client actually attempts to connect to the server through the address we specify,\nthen, the socket object needs to accept this incoming connection. When we\naccept it, then, the connection is established, client and server are now\nconnected to each other, and they can read or write messages in this\nestablished connection.\n\nAfter we received the HTTP Request from the client,\nand sent the HTTP Response to the client,\nwe can now close the connection, and end\nthis communication.\n\n\n## Implementing the server - Part 1\n\n### Creating the socket object {#sec-create-socket}\n\nLet's begin with creating the socket for our server.\nJust to make things shorter, I will create this socket object in\na separate Zig module. I will name it `config.zig`.\n\nIn Zig, we can create a web socket using\nthe `std.posix.socket()` function, from the Zig Standard Library.\nAs I meantioned earlier at @sec-http-how-impl, every socket object we create\nrepresents a communication channel, and we need to bind this channel to a specific address.\nAn \"address\" is defined as an IP address, or, more specifically, an IPv4 address^[It can be also an IPv6 address. But normally, we use a IPv4 address for that.].\nEvery IPv4 address is composed by two components. The first component is the host,\nwhich is a sequence of 4 numbers separated by dot characters (`.`) that identifies the machine used.\nWhile the second component is a port number, which identifies the specific\ndoor, or, the specific port to use in the host.\n\nThe sequence of 4 numbers (i.e. the host) identifies the machine (i.e. the computer itselft) where\nthis socket will live in. Every computer normally have multiple \"doors\" available inside him, because \nthis allows the computer to receive multiple connections at the same time.\nHe simply use a single door for each connection. So the port number, is\nessentially a number that identifies the specific door in the computer that will be resposible\nfor receiving the connection. That is, it identifies the \"door\" in the computer that the socket will use\nto receive incoming connections.\n\nTo make things simpler, I will use an IP address that identifies our current machine in this example.\nThis means that, our socket object will reside on the same computer that we are currently using\n(this is also known as the \"localhost\") to write this Zig source code.\n\nBy convention, the IP address that identifies the \"locahost\", which is the current machine we\nare using, is the IP `127.0.0.1`. So, that is the IP\naddress we are going to use in our server. I can declare it in Zig\nby using an array of 4 integers, like this: `[4]u8{ 127, 0, 0, 1 }`.\n\nNow, we need to decide which port number to use. By convention, there are some\nport numbers that are reserved, meaning that, we cannot use them for our own\npurposes, like the port 22 (which is normally used for SSH connections).\nFor TCP connections, which is our case here,\na port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer (type `u16` in Zig),\nthus ranging from 0 to 65535 [@wikipedia_port].\nSo, we can choose\na number from 0 to 65535 for our port number. In the \nexample of this book, I will use the port number 3490\n(just a random number).\n\n\nNow that we have these two informations at hand, I can\nfinally create our socket object, using the `std.posix.socket()` function.\nFirst, we use the host and the port number to create an `Address` object,\nwith the `std.net.Address.initIp4()` function, like in the example below.\nAfter that, I use this address object inside the `socket()` function\nto create our socket object.\n\nThe `Socket` struct defined below summarizes all the logic behind this\nthis process. In this struct, we have two data members, which are:\n1)  the address object; 2) and a stream object, which is\nthe object we will use to read and write the messages into any connection we establish.\n\nNotice that, inside the constructor method of this struct,\nwhen we create the socket object, we are using the `IPROTO.TCP` property as an input to\ntell the function to create a socket for TCP connections.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst builtin = @import(\"builtin\");\nconst net = @import(\"std\").net;\n\npub const Socket = struct {\n    _address: std.net.Address,\n    _stream: std.net.Stream,\n\n    pub fn init() !Socket {\n        const host = [4]u8{ 127, 0, 0, 1 };\n        const port = 3490;\n        const addr = net.Address.initIp4(host, port);\n        const socket = try std.posix.socket(\n            addr.any.family,\n            std.posix.SOCK.STREAM,\n            std.posix.IPPROTO.TCP\n        );\n        const stream = net.Stream{ .handle = socket };\n        return Socket{ ._address = addr, ._stream = stream };\n    }\n};\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Listening and receiving connections\n\nNotice in the example below that, we stored the `Socket` struct\ndeclaration that we built at @sec-create-socket inside a Zig module named `config.zig`.\nThat is why I imported this module into our main module (`main.zig`) in the example below, as the `SocketConf` object,\nto access the `Socket` struct.\n\nOnce we created our socket object, we can focus now on making this socket object to\nlisten and receive new incoming connections. We do that, by calling the `listen()`\nmethod from the `Address` object that is contained in the socket object, and then,\nwe call the `accept()` method over the result.\n\nThe `listen()` method from the `Address` object produces a server object,\nwhich is an object that will stay open and running indefinitely, waiting\nto receive an incoming connection. Therefore, if you run the Zig\ncode below, by calling the `run` command from the `zig` compiler,\nyou will notice that the programs keeps running indefinitely,\nwithout a clear end.\n\nThis happens, because the program is waiting for something to happen.\nIt is waiting for someone to try to connect to the address (`http://127.0.0.1:3490`) where\nthe server is running and listening for incoming connections. This is what\nthe `listen()` method do, it makes the socket to be active waiting for someone\nto connect.\n\nOn the other side, the `accept()` method is the function that establish the connection\nwhen someone try to connect to the socket. This means that, the `accept()` method\nreturns a new connection object as a result. And you can use this connection object\nto read or write messages from or to the client.\n\nFor now, we are not doing anything with this connection object.\nBut we are going to use it on the next section.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst SocketConf = @import(\"config.zig\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const socket = try SocketConf.Socket.init();\n    try stdout.print(\"Server Addr: {any}\\n\", .{socket._address});\n    var server = try socket._address.listen(.{});\n    const connection = try server.accept();\n    _ = connection;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis code example allows one single connection. In other words, the\nserver will wait for one incoming connection, and as soon as the\nserver is done with the first connection it establishs, the\nprogram ends, and the server stops.\n\nThis is not the norm on the real world. Most people that write\na HTTP server like this, usually put the `accept()` method\ninside a `while` (infinite) loop, where if a connection\nis created with accept, a new thread is created to deal with\nthis new connection and the client.\n\nWith this design, the server simply accepts the connection,\nand the whole process of dealing with the client, and receiving\nthe HTTP Request, and sending the HTTP Response, all of this\nis done in the background, on a separate execution thread.\n\nSo, as soon as the server accepts the connection, and creates\nthe separate thread, the server goes back to what he was doing,\nwhich is to wait indefinitely for a new connection to accept.\nHaving this in mind, the code example exposed above, is a\nserver that serves only a single client. Because the program\nterminates as soon as the connection is accepted.\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n=======\n\n\n### Reading the message from the client\n\nNow that we have a connection established, through our connection\nobject that we created through the `accept()` function, we can now\nuse this connection object to read any messages that the client\nsend to our server. But we can also use it to send messages back\nto the client.\n\nThe basic idea is, if we **write** any data into this connection object,\nthen, we are sending data to the client, and if we **read** the data present in\nthis connection object, then, we are reading any data that the\nclient sent to us, through this connection object. So, just\nhave this logic in mind. \"Read\" is for reading messages from the client,\nand \"write\" is to send a message to the client.\n\nRemember from @sec-how-http-works that, the first thing that we need to do is to read the HTTP Request\nsent by the client to our server. Because it is the first message that happens\ninside the established connection, and, as a consequence, it is the first\nthing that we need to deal with.\n\nThat is why, I'm going to create a new Zig module in this small project, named `request.zig`\nto keep all functions related to the HTTP Request\ntogether. Then, I will create a new function named `read_request()` that will\nuse our connection object to read the message sent by the client,\nwhich is the HTTP Request.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst Connection = std.net.Server.Connection;\npub fn read_request(conn: Connection,\n                    buffer: []u8) !void {\n    const reader = conn.stream.reader();\n    _ = try reader.read(buffer);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis function accepts a slice object which behaves as a buffer.\nThe `read_request()` function reads the contents of the message sent into\nthe connection object, and saves this content into this buffer we provided\nas input.\n\nNotice that I'm using the connection object that we created to read\nthe message from the client. I first access the `reader` object that lives inside the\nconnection object. Then, I call the `read()` method of this `reader` object\nto effectivelly read and save the data sent by the client into the buffer object\nthat we created earlier. I'm discarting the return value\nof the `read()` method, by assigning it to the underscore character (`_`),\nbecause this return value is not useful for us right now.\n\n\n\n## Looking at the current state of the program\n\nYou might have \n\nI think it is a good time to see how our program is currently working. Shall we?\nSo, the first thing I will do is to update the `main.zig` module in our small Zig project,\nso that the `main()` function call this new `read_request()` function that we just created.\nI will also add a print statement at the end of the `main()` function,\njust so that you can see what the HTTP Request we just loaded into the buffer object\nlooks like.\n\nAlso, I'm creating a buffer object, which will be\nresponsible for storing the message sent by the client, and, I'm also\nusing a `for` loop to initialize all fields of this buffer object to the number zero.\nThis is important to make sure that we don't have uninitialized memory in\nthis object. Because uninitialized may cause undefined behaviour in our program.\n\nSince the `read_request()` receives the buffer object as a slice object (`[]u8`),\nI am using the syntax `array[0..array.len]` to get a slice of this `buffer` object\nto provide as input to the function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst SocketConf = @import(\"config.zig\");\nconst Request = @import(\"request.zig\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const socket = try SocketConf.Socket.init();\n    try stdout.print(\"Server Addr: {any}\\n\", .{socket._address});\n    var server = try socket._address.listen(.{});\n    const connection = try server.accept();\n    var buffer: [1000]u8 = undefined;\n    for (0..buffer.len) |i| {\n        buffer[i] = 0;\n    }\n    _ = try Request.read_request(\n        connection, buffer[0..buffer.len]\n    );\n    try stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{buffer});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, I'm going to execute this program, with the `run` command from the\n`zig` compiler. But remember, as we sad earlier, as soon as I execute this program, it will\nhang indefinitely, because the program is waiting for a client trying to\nconnect to the server.\n\nMore specifically, the program will pause at the line\nwith the `accept()` call. As soon as a client try to connect to the\nserver, then, the execution will \"unpause\", and the `accept()` function\nwill finally be executed to create the\nconnection object we need, and the remaining of the program\nwill run.\n\nYou can see that at @fig-print-zigrun1. The message\n`Server Addr: 127.0.0.1:3490` is printed to the console, and the program\nis now waiting for an incoming connection.\n\n![A screenshot of running the program](./../Figures/print-zigrun1.png){#fig-print-zigrun1}\n\n\nWell, we can finally try to connect to this server. There are several ways we can do this.\nFor example, we could use the following Python script:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nrequests.get(\"http://127.0.0.1:3490\")\n```\n\nOr, you could also open any web browser of your preference, and type\nthe URL `localhost:3490`. OBS: localhost is the same thing as the\nIP `127.0.0.1`. When you press enter, and your web browser go\nto this address, first, the browser will probably print a message\nsaying that \"this page isn't working\", and, then, it will\nprobably change to a new message saying that \"the site can't be\nreached\". You get these \"error messages\" in the browser, because\nit got no response back from the server (we are not sending a HTTP Response yet).\n\nBut that is okay. We achieved the result we want,\nwhich is to connect to the server, and see the HTTP Request\nthat was sent by the web browser (or by the Python script)\nto the server.\n\nIf you comeback to the console that you left open\nwhen you executed the program, you will see that the\nprogram finished it's execution, and, a new message is\nprinted in the console, which is the actual HTTP Request\nmessage that was sent by the web browser to the server.\nYou can see that at @fig-print-zigrun2.\n\n![A screenshot of the HTTP Request sent by the web browser](./../Figures/print-zigrun2.png){#fig-print-zigrun2}\n\n\n\n\n## Learning about Enums in Zig {#sec-enum}\n\nEnums structures are available in Zig through the `enum` keyword.\nAn enum (short for \"enumeration\") is a special structure that represents a group of constant values.\nSo, if you have a variable which can assume a short and known\nset of values, you might want to associate this variable to an enum structure,\nto make sure that this variable only assumes a value from this set.\n\nA classic example for enums are primary colors. If for some reason, your program\nneeds to represent one of the primary colors, you can create a enum\nthat represents one of these colors.\nIn the example below, we are creating the enum `PrimaryColorRGB`, which\nrepresents a primary color from the RGB color system. By using this enum,\nI am garanteed that the `acolor` object for example, will contain\none of these three values: `RED`, `GREEN` or `BLUE`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst PrimaryColorRGB = enum {\n    RED, GREEN, BLUE\n};\nconst acolor = PrimaryColorRGB.RED;\n_ = acolor;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf for some reason, my code tries to save in `acolor`,\na value that is not in this set, I will get an error message\nwarning me that a value such as \"MAGENTA\" do not exist\ninside the `PrimaryColorRGB` enum.\nThen I can easily fix my mistake.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst acolor = PrimaryColorRGB.MAGENTA;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\ne1.zig:5:36: error: enum 'PrimaryColorRGB' has\n        no member named 'MAGENTA':\n    const acolor = PrimaryColorRGB.MAGENTA;\n                                   ^~~~~~~\n```\n\nBehind the hood, enums in Zig work the same way that enums\nwork in C. Each enum value is essentially represented as a integer.\nThe first value in the set is represented as zero,\nthen, the second value is one, ... etc.\n\nOne thing that we are going to learn on the next section is that\nenums can have methods in them. Wait... What? This is amazing!\nYes, enums in Zig are similar to structs, and they can have\nprivate and public methods inside them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Implementing the server - Part 2\n\nNow, on this section, I want to focus on parsing\nthe HTTP Request we received from the client.\nHowever, to effectively parse a HTTP Request message, we first need to understand it's\nstructure.\nIn summary, a HTTP Request is a text message that is divided into 3 different\nsections (or parts):\n\n- The top-level header indicating the method of the HTTP Request, the URI, and the HTTP version used in the message.\n- A list of HTTP Headers.\n- The body of the HTTP Request.\n\n### The top-level header\n\nThe first line of text in a HTTP Request always come with the three most essential\ninformation about the request being analyzed. These three key attributes of the HTTP Request\nare separated by a simple space in this first line of the request.\nThe first information is the HTTP method that is being\nused in the request, second, we have the URI to which this HTTP Request is being sent to,\nand third, we have the version of the HTTP protocol that is being used in this HTTP Request.\n\nIn the snippet below, you will find an example of this first line in a HTTP Request.\nFirst, we have the the HTTP method of this request (`GET`). Many programmers\nrefer to the URI component (`/users/list`) as the \"API endpoint\" to which the HTTP Request\nis being sent to. In the context of this specific request, since it is a GET request,\nyou could also say that the URI component is the path to the resource we want to access,\nor, the path to the document (or the file) that we want to retrieve from the server.\n\n```\nGET /users/list HTTP/1.1\n```\n\nAlso, notice that this HTTP Request is using the version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol,\nwhich is the most popular version of the protocol used in the web.\n\n\n\n### The list of HTTP headers\n\nMost HTTP Requests also include a section of HTTP Headers,\nwhich is just a list of attributes or key-value pairs associated with this\nparticular request. This section always comes right after the \"top-level header\" of the request.\n\nFor our purpose in this chapter, which is to build a simple HTTP Server,\nwe are going to ignore this section of the HTTP Request, for simplicity.\nBut most HTTP servers that exist in the wild parses and use these\nHTTP headers to change the way that the server responds to the request\nsend by the client.\n\nFor example, many requests we encounter in the real-world comes with\na HTTP header called `Accept`. In this header, we find a list of [MIME types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)[^mime].\nThis list indicates the file formats that the client can read, or parse, or interpret.\nIn other words, you also interpret this header as the client saying the following phrase\nto the server: \"Hey! Look, I can read only HTML documents, so please, send me back\na document that is in a HTML format.\".\n\n[^mime]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type>.\n\nSo, if the HTTP server can read and use this `Accept` header, then, the server can identify\nwhich is the best format of the document to send to the client. Maybe the HTTP server have\nthe same document in multiple formats, for example, in JSON, in XML, in HTML and in PDF,\nbut the client can only understand documents in the format HTML. That is the purpose\nof this `Accept` header.\n\n\n### The body\n\nThe body comes after the list of HTTP headers, and it is an optional section of the HTTP Request, meaning that, not\nall HTTP Request will come with a body in it. For example, every HTTP Request that uses the\nGET method usually do not come with a body.\n\nBecause a GET request is used to request data,\ninstead of sending it to the server. So, the body section is more related to the POST method, which is a method that involves\nsending data to the server, to be processed and stored.\n\nSince we are going to support only the GET method in this project, it means that\nwe also do not need to care about the body of the request.\n\n\n\n### Creating the HTTP Method enum\n\nEvery HTTP Request comes with a explicit method. The method used in a HTTP Request\nis identified by one these words:\n\n- GET;\n- POST;\n- OPTIONS;\n- PATCH;\n- DELETE;\n- and some other methods.\n\nEach HTTP method is used for a specific type of task. The POST method for example is normally\nused to post some data into the destination. In other words, it is used\nto send some data to the HTTP server, so that it can be processed and stored by the server.\n\nAs another example, the GET method is normally used to get content from the server.\nIn other words, we use this method whenever we want the server to send some\ncontent back to us. It can be any type of content. It can be a web page,\na document file, or some data in JSON format.\n\nWhen a client send a POST HTTP Request, the HTTP Response sent by the server normally have the sole purpose of\nletting the client know if the server processed and stored the data succesfully.\nIn contrast, when the server receives a GET HTTP Request, then, the server sends the content\nthat the client asked for in the HTTP Response itself. This demonstrates that the method associated\nwith the HTTP Request changes a lot on the dynamics and the roles that each party\nplays in the whole process.\n\nSince the HTTP method of the HTTP Request is identified by this very small and specific\nset of words, it would be interesting to create an enum structure to represent a HTTP method.\nThis way, we can easily check if the HTTP Request we receive from the client is a\nHTTP method that we currently support in our small HTTP server project.\n\nThe `Method` structure below represents this enumeration.\nNotice that, for now, only the GET HTTP method is included in this\nenumeration. Because, for the purpose of this chapter, I want to\nimplement only the GET HTTP method. That is why I am not\nincluding the other HTTP methods in this enumeration.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\npub const Method = enum {\n    GET\n};\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, I think we should add two methods to this enum structure. One method is `is_supported()`,\nwhich will be a function that returns a boolean value, indicating if the input HTTP method is supported\nor not by our HTTP Server. The other is `init()`, which is a constructor function that takes a string as input,\nand tries to convert it into a `Method` value.\n\n\nBut in order to build these functions, I will use a functionality from the Zig Standard Library, called\n`StaticStringMap()`. This function allows us to create a simple map from strings to enum values.\nIn other words, we can use this map structure to map a string to the respective enum value.\nTo some extent, this specific structure from the standard library works almost like a \"hashtable\" structure,\nand it is optmized for a small sets of words, or, a small set of keys, which is our case here.\n\nTo use this function, you have to import it from the `std.static_string_map` module. Just\nto make things shorter and easier to type, I am going to import this function through a different\nand shorter name (`Map`).\n\nWith `Map()` imported, we just apply this function over the enum structure\nthat we are going to use in the resulting map. In our case here, it is the `Method` enum structure\nthat we declared at the last code example. Then, I call the `initComptime()` method with the\nmap, i.e. the list of key-value pairs that we are going to use.\n\nYou can see in the example below that I write this map using multiple anonymous struct literals.\nInside the first (or \"top-level\") struct literal we have a list (or a sequence) of struct literals.\nEach struct literal in this list represents a key-value pair. The first element\nin this struct is the key, while the second element is the value. The first element (or the key)\nin each key-value pair should always be a string value. While the second element should\nbe a value from the enum structure that you used inside the `Map()` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst Map = std.static_string_map.StaticStringMap;\nconst MethodMap = Map(Method).initComptime(.{\n    .{ \"GET\", Method.GET },\n});\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nTherefore, the `MethodMap` object is basically a `std::map` object from C++, or,\na `dict` object from Python. You can retrieve (or get) the enum value that\ncorresponds to a particular key, by using the `get()` method from the map\nobject. This method returns an optional value, so, the `get()` method might\nresult in a null value.\n\nWe can use this in our advantage to detect if a particular HTTP method is\nsupported or not in our HTTP server. Because, if the `get()` method returns null,\nit means that it did not find this method inside our `MethodMap` object, and,\nas a consequence, this method is not supported by our HTTP server.\nIn this specific case, a null value means \"not supported method\".\n\nThe `init()` method below, takes a string value as input, and then, it simply passes this string value\nto the `get()` method of our `MethodMap` object. As consequence, we should get the enum value that corresponds\nto this input string.\n\nNotice in the example below that, the `init()` method returns either an error\n(which might happen if the `?` method returns `unreacheable`, checkout @sec-null-handling for more details)\nor a `Method` object as result. Since `GET` is currently the only value in our `Method` enum\nstructure, it means that, the `init()` method will most likely return the value `Method.GET` as result.\n\nAlso notice that, in the `is_supported()` method, we are using the optional value returned\nby the `get()` method from our `MethodMap` object. The if statement unwrapes the optional value\nreturned by this method, and returns `true` in case this optional value is a not-null value.\nOtherwise, it simply returns `false`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\npub const Method = enum {\n    GET,\n    pub fn init(text: []const u8) !Method {\n        return MethodMap.get(text).?;\n    }\n    pub fn is_supported(m: []const u8) bool {\n        const method = MethodMap.get(m);\n        if (method) |_| {\n            return true;\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Writing the parse request function\n\nNow that we created the enum that represents our HTTP method,\nwe should start to write the function responsible for\nactually parsing the HTTP Request. Let's first, understand\nthe structure of a HTTP Request.\n\nThe first thing we can do, is to write a struct to represent the HTTP Request.\nTake the `Request` struct below as an example. It contains the three\nessential information from the \"top-level\" header (i.e. the first line)\nin the HTTP Request.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst Request = struct {\n    method: Method,\n    version: []const u8,\n    uri: []const u8,\n    pub fn init(method: Method,\n                uri: []const u8,\n                version: []const u8) Request {\n        return Request{\n            .method = method,\n            .uri = uri,\n            .version = version,\n        };\n    }\n};\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe `parse_request()` function should receive a string as input. This input string\ncontains the entire HTTP Request message, and the parsing function should\nread and understand the individual parts of this message.\n\nNow, remember that for the purpose of this chapter, we care about only about the first\nline in this message, which contains the \"top-level header\", or, the three essential attributes about the HTTP Request,\nwhich are the HTTP method used, the URI and the HTTP version.\n\nNotice that I use the function `indexOfScalar()` in `parse_request()`. This function from the\nZig Standard Library returns the first index where the scalar value that we provide\nhappens in a string. In this case, I'm looking at the first occurrence of the new line character (`\\n`).\nBecause once again, we care only about the first line in the HTTP Request message.\nThis is the line where we have the three information we want to parse\n(version of HTTP, the HTTP method and the URI).\n\nTherefore, we are using this `indexOfScalar()` function\nto limit our parsing process to the first line in the message.\nIs also worth mentioning that, the `indexOfScalar()` function returns an optional value.\nThat is why I use the `orelse` keyword to provide an alternative value, in case\nthe value returned by the function is a null value.\n\nSince each of these three attributes are separated by a simple space, we\ncould use the function `splitScalar()` from the Zig Standard Library to split\nthe input string into sections by looking for every position that appears\na simple space. In other words, this `splitScalar()` function is equivalent\nto the `split()` method in Python, or, the `std::getline()` function from C++,\nor the `strtok()` function in C.\n\nWhen you use this `splitScalar()` function you get an iterator as the result.\nThis iterator have a `next()` method that you can use to advance the iterator\nto the next position, or, to the next section of the splitted string.\nNote that, when you use `next()`, the method not only advances the iterator,\nbut it also returns a slice to the current section of the splitted\nstring as result.\n\nNow, if you want to get a slice to the current section of the splitted\nstring, but not advance the iterator to the next position, you can use\nthe `peek()` method. Both `next()` and `peek()` methods return an optional value, that is\nwhy I use the `?` method to unwrap these optional values.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\npub fn parse_request(text: []u8) Request {\n    const line_index = std.mem.indexOfScalar(\n        u8, text, '\\n'\n    ) orelse text.len;\n    var iterator = std.mem.splitScalar(\n        u8, text[0..line_index], ' '\n    );\n    const method = try Method.init(iterator.next().?);\n    const uri = iterator.next().?;\n    const version = iterator.next().?;\n    const request = Request.init(method, uri, version);\n    return request;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHave you notice that the \"string utility functions\" we imported from the Zig Standard Library,\nand that we applied over the input string, comes from the `mem` module (which is the \"memory utility functions\" module)?\n\nAs I described at @sec-zig-strings, strings in Zig are simply arrays of bytes in the language.\nSo, you will find inside this `mem` module lots of excellent utility functions to work directly with bytes\nand arrays in Zig, and, as a result, these functions will also be very useful if you have to work with string data.\n\n\n\n### Using the parse request function\n\nNow that we wrote the function responsible for parsing the HTTP Request,\nwe can add the function call to `parse_request()` in\nthe `main()` function of our program.\n\nAfter, is a good idea to test once again the state of our program.\nI execute this program again with the `run` command from the `zig` compiler,\nthen, I use my web browser to connect once again to the server through the URL `localhost:3490`, and finally,\nthe end result of our `Request` object is printed to the console.\n\nA quick observation, since I used the `any` format specifier in the\nprint statement, the data members `version` and `uri` of the `Request`\nstruct were printed as raw integer values. String data being printed\nas integer values is commom in Zig, and remember, these integer values are just the decimal representation of\nthe bytes that form the string in question.\n\nIn the result below, the sequence of decimal values 72, 84, 84, 80, 47, 49, 46, 49, and 13,\nare the bytes that form the text \"HTTP/1.1\". And the integer 47, is the decimal value of\nthe character `/`, which represents our URI in this request.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst SocketConf = @import(\"config.zig\");\nconst Request = @import(\"request.zig\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const socket = try SocketConf.Socket.init();\n    var server = try socket._address.listen(.{});\n    const connection = try server.accept();\n\n    var buffer: [1000]u8 = undefined;\n    for (0..buffer.len) |i| {\n        buffer[i] = 0;\n    }\n    try Request.read_request(\n        connection, buffer[0..buffer.len]\n    );\n    const request = Request.parse_request(buffer[0..buffer.len]);\n    try stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{request});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nrequest.Request{\n    .method = request.Method.GET,\n    .version = {72, 84, 84, 80, 47, 49, 46, 49, 13},\n    .uri = {47}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Sending the HTTP Response to the client\n\nIn this last part, we are going to write the logic responsible for\nsending the HTTP Response from the server to the client. To make things\nsimple, the server in this project will send just a simple web page\ncontaining the text \"Hello world\".\n\nFirst, I create a new Zig module in the project, named `response.zig`.\nIn this module, I will declare just two functions. Each function\ncorresponds to a specific status code in the HTTP Response.\nThe `send_200()` function will send a HTTP Response with status code 200\n(which means \"Success\") to the client. While the `send_404()` sends a response\nwith status code 404 (which means \"Not found\").\n\nThis is definitely not the most ergonomic and adequate way of handling the\nHTTP Response, but it works for our case here. We are just building toy projects\nin this book after all. So, the source code we write do not need to be perfect.\nIt just needs to work!\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst Connection = std.net.Server.Connection;\npub fn send_200(conn: Connection) !void {\n    const message = (\n        \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nContent-Length: 48\"\n        ++ \"\\nContent-Type: text/html\\n\"\n        ++ \"Connection: Closed\\n\\n<html><body>\"\n        ++ \"<h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>\"\n    );\n    _ = try conn.stream.write(message);\n}\n\npub fn send_404(conn: Connection) !void {\n    const message = (\n        \"HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\\nContent-Length: 50\"\n        ++ \"\\nContent-Type: text/html\\n\"\n        ++ \"Connection: Closed\\n\\n<html><body>\"\n        ++ \"<h1>File not found!</h1></body></html>\"\n    );\n    _ = try conn.stream.write(message);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNotice that both functions receives the connection object as input, and\nuse the `write()` method to write the HTTP Response message directly\ninto this communication channel. As result, the party in the other\nside of the connection (i.e. the client), will receive such message.\n\nMost real-world HTTP Servers will have a single function (or a single struct) to effectively handle\nthe response. It gets the HTTP Request already parsed as input, and then, it tries to build\nthe HTTP Response bit by bit, before the function sends it over the connection.\n\nWe would also have a specialized struct to represent a HTTP Response, and\na lot of methods that would be used to build each part or component of the response object.\nTake the `Response` struct created by the Javascript runtime Bun as an example.\nYou can find this struct in the [`response.zig` module](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/main/src/bun.js/webcore/response.zig)[^bun-resp]\nin their GitHub project.\n\n[^bun-resp]: <https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/main/src/bun.js/webcore/response.zig>.\n\n\n## The end result\n\nWe can now, update once again our `main()` to incorporate our new\nfunctions from the `respons.zig` module. First I need to import this module\ninto our `main.zig` module, then, I add the function calls to `send_200()`\nand `send_404()`.\n\nNotice that I'm using if statements to decide which \"response function\" to call,\nbased specially on the URI present in the HTTP Request. If the user asked for\na content (or a document) that is not present in our server, we should respond\nwith a 404 status code. But since we have just a simple HTTP server, with no\nreal documents to send, we can just check if the URI is the root path (`/`)\nor not to decide which function to call.\n\nAlso, notice that I'm using the function `std.mem.eql()` from the Zig Standard Library\nto check if the string from `uri` is equal or not the string `\"/\"`. This function is\nused to check if two arrays are equal or not. In the first argument, you provide\nthe type of the elements present in this array. While in the second and third arguments,\nyou provide the arrays to be compared.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst SocketConf = @import(\"config.zig\");\nconst Request = @import(\"request.zig\");\nconst Response = @import(\"response.zig\");\nconst Method = Request.Method;\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const socket = try SocketConf.Socket.init();\n    try stdout.print(\"Server Addr: {any}\\n\", .{socket._address});\n    var server = try socket._address.listen(.{});\n    const connection = try server.accept();\n\n    var buffer: [1000]u8 = undefined;\n    for (0..buffer.len) |i| {\n        buffer[i] = 0;\n    }\n    try Request.read_request(connection, buffer[0..buffer.len]);\n    const request = Request.parse_request(buffer[0..buffer.len]);\n    if (request.method == Method.GET) {\n        if (std.mem.eql(u8, request.uri, \"/\")) {\n            try Response.send_200(connection);\n        } else {\n            try Response.send_404(connection);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow that we adjusted our `main()` function, I can now execute our program, and\nsee the effects of these last changes. First, I execute the program once again, with the\n`run` command of the `zig` compiler. The program will hang, waiting for a client to connect.\n\nThen, I open my web browser, and try to connect to the server again, using the URL `localhost:3490`.\nThis time, instead of getting ar \"error message\" from the browser, you will get the message\n\"Hello World\" printed into your web browser. Because this time, the server sended the HTTP Response\nsuccesfully to the web browser, as demonstrated by @fig-print-zigrun3.\n\n\n![The Hello World message sent in the HTTP Response](./../Figures/print-zigrun3.png){#fig-print-zigrun3}\n\n",
