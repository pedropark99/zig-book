As we described at that section, programmers invented Build Systems\nto surpass these challenges on the building processes of low-level languages.\n\nLow-level languages uses a compiler to compile (or to build) your source code into binary instructions.\nIn C and C++, we normally use compilers like `gcc`, `g++` or `clang` to compile\nour C and C++ source code into these instructions.\nEvery language have it's own compiler, and this is no different in Zig.\n\nIn Zig, we have the `zig` compiler to compile our Zig source code into\nbinary instructions that can be executed by our computer.\nIn Zig, the compilation (or the build) process involves\nthe following components:\n\n- The Zig modules that contains your source code;\n- Library files (either a dynamic library or a static library);\n- Compiler flags that tailors the build process to your needs.\n\nThese are the things that you need to connect together in order to build your\nsource code. In C and C++, you would have an extra component, which is the header files of\nthe libraries you are using. But header files do not exist in Zig, so, you only need\nto care about them if you are linking your Zig source code with a C library.\nIf that is not your case, you can forget about it.\n\nYour build process is usually organized into a build script. In Zig, we normally\nwrite this build script into a Zig module in the root directory of our project,\nnamed as `build.zig`. You write this build script, then, when you run it, your project\nget's built into binary files that you can use and distribute to your users.\n\nThis build script is normally organized around *target objects*. A target is simply\nsomething to be built, or, in other words, it's something that you want the `zig` compiler\nto build for you. This concept of \"targets\" is present in most Build Systems,\nspecially in CMake[^cmake].\n\n[^cmake]: <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html>\n\nThere are three types of target objects that you can build in Zig, which are:\n\n- An executable, which is simply a binary executable file (e.g. a `.exe` file on Windows).\n- A shared library, which is simply a binary library file (e.g. a `.so` file in Linux or a `.dll` file on Windows).\n- A static library, which is simply a binary library file (e.g. a `.a` file in Linux or a `.lib` file on Windows).\n- An unit tests executable, which is an executable file that executes only unit tests.\n\nWe are going to talk more about these target objects at @sec-targets.\n\n\n\n## The `build()` function {#sec-build-fun}\n\nA build script in Zig always contains a public (and top-level) `build()` function declared.\nIt is like the `main()` function on the main Zig module of your project, that we discussed at @sec-main-file.\nBut instead of creating the entrypoint to your code, this `build()` function is the entrypoint to the build process.\n\nThis `build()` function should accept a pointer to a `Build` object as input, and it should use this \"build object\" to perform\nthe necessary steps to build your project. The return type of this function is always `void`,\nand this `Build` struct comes directly from the Zig Standard Library (`std.Build`). So, you can \naccess this struct by just importing the Zig Standard Library into your module.\n\nJust as a very simple example, here you can see the source code necessary to build\nan executable file from the `hello.zig` Zig module.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\npub fn build(b: *std.Build) void {\n    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n        .name = \"hello\",\n        .root_source_file = b.path(\"hello.zig\"),\n        .target = b.host,\n    });\n    b.installArtifact(exe);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can define and use other functions and objects in this build script. You can also import\nother Zig modules as you would normally do in any other module of your project.\nThe only real requirement for this build script, is to have a public and top-level\n`build()` function defined, that accepts a pointer to a `Build` struct as input.\n\n\n## Target objects {#sec-targets}\n\nAs we described over the previous sections, a build script is composed around target objects.\nEach target object is normally a binary file (or an output) that you want to get from the build process. You can list\nmultiple target objects in your build script, so that the build process generates multiple\nbinary files for you at once.\n\nFor example, you may be a developer working in a cross-platform application,\nand, because this application is cross-platform, you probably need to realease\nbinary files of your software for each OS supported by your application to your end users.\nYou can define a target object in your build script\nfor each OS (Windows, Linux, etc.) where you want to publish your software.\nThis will make the `zig` compiler to build your project to multiple target OS's at once.\n\nA target object is created by the following methods of the `Build` struct that we introduced\nat @sec-build-fun:\n\n- `addExecutable()` creates an executable file;\n- `addSharedLibrary()` creates a shared library file;\n- `addStaticLibrary()` creates a static library file;\n- `addTest()` creates an executable file that executes unit tests.\n\n\nThese functions are methods from the `Build` struct that you receive\nas input of the `build()` function. All of them, create as output\na `Compile` object, which represents a target object to be compiled\nby the `zig` compiler. All of these functions accept a similar struct literal as input.\nThis struct literal defines three essential specs about this target object that you are building:\n`name`, `target` and `root_source_file`.\n\nWe already saw these three options being used on the previous example,\nwhere we used the `addExecutable()` method to create an executable target object.\nThis example is reproduced below. Notice the use of the `path()` method\nfrom the `Build` struct, to define a path in the `root_source_file` option.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nexe = b.addExecutable(.{\n    .name = \"hello\",\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"hello.zig\"),\n    .target = b.host,\n});\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `name` option specificy the name that you want to give to the binary file defined\nby this target. So, in this example, we are building an executable file named `hello`.\nIs traditional to set this `name` option to the name of your project.\n\n\nFurthermore, the `target` option specify the target computer architecture (or operational system) of this\nbinary file. For example, if you want this target object to run on a Windows machine\nthat uses a `x86_64` architecture, you can set this `target` option to the `x86_64-windows-gnu` target.\nThis will make the `zig` compiler to compile the project to run on a `x86_64` Windows machine.\n\nNow, if you are building the project to run on the current machine\nthat you are using to run this build script, you can set this `target`\noption to the `host` method of the `Build` object, like we did in the example above.\nThis `host` method identifies the current machine where you are\ncurrently running the `zig` compiler.\n\n\nAt last, the `root_source_file` option specifies the root Zig module of your project.\nThat is the Zig module that contains the entrypoint to your application (i.e. the `main()` function), or, the main API of your library.\nThis also means that, all the Zig modules that compose your project are automatically discovered\nfrom the import statements that you have inside this \"root source file\".\nThe `zig` compiler can detect when a Zig module depends on the other through the import statements,\nand, as a result, it can discover the entire map of Zig modules used in your project.\n\nThis is handy, and it is different than what happens in other build systems.\nIn CMake for example, you have to explicitly list the paths to all source files that you want to\ninclude in your build process. This is probably a symptom of the lack of conditional\ncompilation in C and C++ compilers. Because they lack this feature that Zig has, you have\nto explicitly choose which source files are sent to the C/C++ compiler, since not\nevery C/C++ code is portable or supported in every operational system, and, therefore,\nwould cause a compilation error in the C/C++ compiler.\n\n\nNow, one important detail about the build process is that, you have to **explicitly\ninstall the target objects that you create in your build script**, by using the\n`installArtifact()` method of the `Build` struct.\n\nEverytime you invoke the build process of your project, by calling the `build` command\nof the `zig` compiler, a new directory named `zig-out` is created in the root\ndirectory of your project. This new directory contains the output of the build process,\nthat is, the binary files built from your source code.\n\nWhat the `installArtifact()` method do is  install (or copy) the built target objects\nthat you defined in this `zig-out` directory.\nThis means that, if you do not\ninstall the target objects you define in your build script, these target objects are\nessentially discarded at the end of the build process.\n\nFor example, you might be building a project that uses a third party library that is built\ntogether with the project. So, when you build your project, you would need to first,\nbuild the third party library, and then, you link it with the source code of your project.\nSo, in this case, we have two binary files that are generated in the build process.\nBut only one is of interest, which is the executable file of our project.\nWe can discard the binary file of the third party library, by simply not installing it\ninto this `zig-out` directory.\n\nSo, is easy to use this `installArtifact()` method. Just remember to apply it to every\ntarget object that you want to save it into the `zig-out` directory, like in the example below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nexe = b.addExecutable(.{\n    .name = \"hello\",\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"hello.zig\"),\n    .target = b.host,\n});\n\nb.installArtifact(exe);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Setting the build mode\n\nWe talked about the three essential options that are set when you create a new target object.\nBut there is also a fourth option that you can use to set the build mode of this target object,\nwhich is the `optimize` option.\nThis option is called this way, because the build modes in Zig are treated more of\nan \"optimization vs safety\" problem. So optmization plays an important role here.\nDon't worry, I'm going back to this question very soon.\n\nIn Zig, we have the four build modes listed below. Each one of these build modes offer\ndifferent advantages and characteristics. As we described at @sec-compile-debug-mode, the `zig` compiler\nuses the `Debug` build mode by default, when you don't explicitly choose a build mode.\n\n- `Debug`, mode that produces and includes debugging information in the output of the build process (i.e. the binary file defined by the target object);\n- `ReleaseSmall`, mode that tries to produce a binary file that is small in size;\n- `ReleaseFast`, mode that tries to optimize your code, in order to produce a binary file that is as fast as possible;\n- `ReleaseSafe`, mode that tries to make your code as safe as possible, by including safeguards when possible.\n\nSo, when you build your project, you can set the build mode of your target object to `ReleaseFast` for example, which will tell\nthe `zig` compiler to apply important optimizations in your code. This creates a binary file\nthat simply runs faster on most contexts, because it contains a more optimized version of your code.\nHowever, as a result, we normally loose some security funcionalities in our code.\nBecause some safety checks are removed from the final binary file,\nwhich makes your code run faster, but in a less safe manner.\n\nThis choice depends on your current priorities. If you are building a cryptography or banking system, you might\nprefer to prioritize safety in your code, so, you would choose the `ReleaseSafe` build mode, which is a little\nslower to run, but much more secure, because it includes all possible runtime safety checks in the binary file\nbuilt in the build process. In the other hand, if you are writing a game for example, you might prefer to prioritize performance\nover safety, by using the `ReleaseFast` build mode, so that your users can experience faster frame rates in your game.\n\nIn the example below, we are creating the same\ntarget object that we used on previous examples. But this time, we are specifying\nthe build mode of this target object to use the `ReleaseSafe` mode.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n    .name = \"hello\",\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"hello.zig\"),\n    .target = b.host,\n    .optimize = .ReleaseSafe\n});\nb.installArtifact(exe);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Setting the version of your build\n\nEverytime you build a target object in your build script, you can assign a version\nnumber to this specific build, following a semantic versioning framework.\nYou can find more about semantic versioning by visiting the [Semantic Versioning website](https://semver.org/)[^semver].\nAnyway, in Zig,\nyou can specify the version of your build, by providing a `SemanticVersion` struct to\nthe `version` option, like in the example below:\n\n\n[^semver]: <https://semver.org/>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n    .name = \"hello\",\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"hello.zig\"),\n    .target = b.host,\n    .version = .{\n        .major = 2, .minor = 9, .patch = 7\n    }\n});\nb.installArtifact(exe);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Detecting the OS in your build script\n\nIs very commom in Build Systems to use different options, or, to include different modules, or,\nto link against different libraries depending on the Operational System (OS)\nthat you are targeting in the build process.\n\nIn Zig, you can detect the target OS of the build process, by looking\nat the `os.tag` inside the `builtin` module from the Zig library.\nIn the example below, we are using an if statement to run some\narbitrary code when the target of the build process is the\nWindows system.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst builtin = @import(\"builtin\");\nif (builtin.target.os.tag == .windows) {\n    // Code that runs only when the target of\n    // the compilation process is Windows.\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Adding a run step to your build process\n\nOne thing that is neat in Rust is that you can compile and run your\nsource code with one single command (`cargo run`) from the Rust compiler.\nWe saw at @sec-compile-run-code how can we perform a similar job in Zig, by\nbuilding and running our Zig source code through the `run` command from the `zig` compiler.\n\nBut how can we, at the same time, build and run the binary file specified by a target object in our\nbuild script?\nThe answer is by including a \"run artifact\" in our build script.\nA run artifact is created through the `addRunArtifact()` method from the `Build` struct.\nWe simply provide as input to this function the target object that describes the binary file that we\nwant to execute, and the function creates as output, a run artifact capable of executing\nthis binary file.\n\nIn the example below, we are defining an executable binary file named `hello`,\nand we use this `addRunArtifact()` method to create a run artifact that will execute\nthis `hello` executable file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst exe = b.addExecutable(.{\n    .name = \"hello\",\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"src/hello.zig\"),\n    .target = b.host\n});\nb.installArtifact(exe);\nconst run_arti = b.addRunArtifact(exe);\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we created the run artifact, we need to include it in\nthe build process. We do that by declaring a new \"build step\" in our build\nscript to call this artifact, through the `step()` method of the `Build`\nstruct.\nWe can give any name we want to this step, but, for our\ncontext here, I'm going to name this step as \"run\".\nAlso, I give it a brief description to this step (\"Run the project\").\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst run_step = b.step(\n    \"run\", \"Run the project\"\n);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we declared this \"run step\" we need to tell Zig that\nthis \"run step\" depends on the run artifact.\nIn other words, a run artifact always depends on a \"build step\" to effectivelly be executed.\nBy creating this dependency\nwe finally stablish the necessary commands to build and run the executable file\nfrom the build script.\n\nWe establish a dependency between the run step and the run artifact\nby using the `dependsOn()` method from the run step. So, we first\ncreate the run step, and then, we link it with the run artifact, by\nusing this `dependsOn()` method from the run step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nrun_step.dependOn(&run_arti.step);\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe entire source code of this specific build script that\nwe wrote, piece by piece, in this section, is\navailable in the `build_and_run.zig` module. You can\nsee this module by\n[visiting the official repository of this book](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/blob/main/ZigExamples/build_system/build_and_run.zig)\n[^module-src].\n\n\n[^module-src]: <https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/blob/main/ZigExamples/build_system/build_and_run.zig>\n\nWhen you declare a new build step in your build script, this step\nbecomes available through the `build` command in the `zig` compiler.\nYou can actually see this step by running `zig build --help` in the terminal, like\nin the example below, where we can see that this new \"run\"\nstep that we declared in the build script appeared in the output.\n\n```bash\nzig build --help\n```\n\n```\nSteps:\n  ...\n  run   Run the project\n  ...\n```\n\nNow, everything that we need to is to\ncall this \"run\" step that we created in our build script. We\ncall it by using the name that we gave to this step\nafter the `build` command from the `zig` compiler.\nThis will cause the compiler to build our executable file\nand execute it at the same time.\n\n```bash\nzig build run\n```\n\n## Build for unit tests\n\nWe talk at length about writing unit tests in Zig, and we also talk about how to execute these unit tests through\nthe `test` command of the `zig` compiler at @sec-unittests. However,\nas we did with the `run` command on the previous section, we also might want to\ninclude some commands in our build script to also build and execute the unit tests in our project.\n\nSo, once again, we are going to discuss how a specific built-in command from the `zig` compiler,\n(in this case, the `test` command) can be used in a build script in Zig.\nThis means that, we can include a step in our build script to build and run\nunit tests in the project at once.\n\nHere is where a test target object comes into play.\nAs was described at @sec-targets, we can create a test target object by using the `addTest()` method of\nthe `Build` struct. So the first thing that we need to do is to\ndeclare a test target object in our build script.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst test_exe = b.addTest(.{\n    .name = \"unit_tests\",\n    .root_source_file = b.path(\"src/main.zig\"),\n    .target = b.host,\n});\nb.installArtifact(test_exe);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nA test target object essentially filter all `test` blocks in all Zig modules\nacross your project, and builds only the source code present inside\nthese `test` blocks in your project. As a result, this target object\ncreates an executable file that contains only the source code present\nin all of these `test` blocks (i.e. the unit tests) in your project.\n\nPerfect, now that we declared this test target object, an executable file\nnamed `unit_tests` is built by the `zig` compiler when we trigger the build\nscript with the `build` command from the `zig` compiler. After the build\nprocess is finished, we can simply execute this `unit_tests` executable\nin the terminal.\n\nThough, if you remember from the previous section, we already learned\nhow can we create a run step in our build script, to execute an executable file\nbuilt by the build script.\n\nSo, we could simply add a run step in our build script to run these unit tests\nfrom a single command in the `zig` compiler, to make our lifes easier.\nIn the example below, we demonstrate the commands to\nregister a new build step called \"tests\" in our build script\nto run these unit tests.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst run_arti = b.addRunArtifact(test_exe);\nconst run_step = b.step(\"tests\", \"Run unit tests\");\nrun_step.dependOn(&run_arti.step);\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we registered this new build step, we can call it\nand trigger the execution process by calling the command below\nin the terminal. You can also checkout the complete source\ncode for this specific build script at the\n[official repository of this book](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/blob/main/ZigExamples/build_system/build_tests.zig)\n[^module-src2].\n\n\n[^module-src2]: <https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/blob/main/ZigExamples/build_system/build_tests.zig>\n\n\n```bash\nzig build tests\n```\n\n\n## Tailoring your build process with user provided options\n\n\n## Linking with external libraries\n\n\n\n\n",
