In other words,\nwe haven't discussed yet how to call and use C code from Zig.\n\nThis is the main subject of this chapter.\nAlso, in our next small project in this book, we are going to use a C library in it.\nAs consequence, we will put in practice a lot of the knowledge discussed here on\nthis next project.\n\n\n## How to call C code from Zig\n\nInteroperability with C is not something new. Most high-level programming languages have FFI (foreign function interfaces),\nwhich can be used to call C code. For example, Python have Cython, R have `.Call()`, Javascript have `ccall()`, etc.\nBut Zig integrates with C in a deeper level, which affects not only the way that C code get's called, but also,\nhow this C code is compiled and incorporated into your Zig project.\n\nIn summary, Zig have great interoperability with C. If you want to call any C code from Zig,\nyou have to perform the following steps:\n\n- import a C header file into your Zig code.\n- link your Zig code with the C library.\n\n\n### Strategies to import C header files {#sec-strategy-c}\n\nUsing C code in Zig always involves performing the two steps cited above. However, when\nwe talk specifically about the first step listed above, there are currently two\ndifferent ways to perform this first step, which are:\n\n- translating the C header file into Zig code, through the `zig translate-c` command, and then, import and use the translated Zig code.\n- importing the C header file directly into your Zig module through the `@cImport()` built-in function.\n\nIf you are not familiar with `translate-c`, this is a subcommand inside the `zig` compiler that takes C files\nas input, and outputs the Zig representation of the C code present in these C files.\nIn other words, this subcommand works like a transpiler. It takes C code, and translates it into\nthe equivalent Zig code.\n\nI think it would be ok to interpret `translate-c` as a tool to generate Zig bindings\nto C code, similarly to the `rust-bindgen`[^bindgen] tool, which generates Rust FFI bindings to C code.\nBut that would not be a precise interpretation of `translate-c`. The idea behind this tool is\nto really translate the C code into Zig code.\n\n[^bindgen]: <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen>\n\nNow, on a surface level, `@cImport()` versus `translate-c` might seem like\ntwo completely different strategies. But in fact, they are effectively the exact same strategy.\nBecause, under the hood, the `@cImport()` built-in function is just a shortcut to `translate-c`.\nBoth tools use the same \"C to Zig\" translation functionality. So when you use `@cImport()`,\nyou are essentially asking the `zig` compiler to translate the C header file into Zig code, then,\nto import this Zig code into your current Zig module.\n\nAt the present moment, there is an accepted proposal at the Zig project, to move `@cImport()`\nto the Zig build system[^cimport-issue]. If this proposal is completed, then, the \"use `@cImport()`\"\nstrategy would be transformed into \"call a translate C function in your Zig build script\".\nSo, the step of translating the C code into Zig code would be moved to\nthe build script of your Zig project, and you would only need to import the translated Zig code into\nyour Zig module to start calling C code from Zig.\n\n[^cimport-issue]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20630>\n\nIf you think about this proposal for a minute, you will understand that this is actually\na small change. I mean, the logic is the same, and the steps are still essentially the same.\nThe only difference is that one of the steps will be moved to the build script of your Zig project.\n\n\n\n### Linking Zig code with a C library {#sec-linking-c}\n\nRegardless of which of the two strategies from the previous section you choose,\nif you want to call C code from Zig, you must link your Zig code\nwith the C library that contains the C code that you want to call.\n\nIn other words, everytime you use some C code in your Zig code, **you introduce a dependency in your build process**.\nThis should come as no surprise to anyone that have any experience with C and C++.\nBecause this is no different in C. Everytime you use a C library in your C code, you also\nhave to build and link your C code with this C library that you are using.\n\nWhen we use a C library in our Zig code, the `zig` compiler needs to access the definition of the C functions that\nare being called in your Zig code. The C header file of this library provides the\ndeclarations of these C functions, but not their definitions. So, in order to access these definitions,\nthe `zig` compiler needs to build your Zig code and link it with the C library during the build process.\n\nAs we discussed across the @sec-build-system, there are different strategies to link something with a library.\nThis might involve building the C library first, and then, linking it with the Zig code. Or,\nit could also involve just the linking step, if this C library is already built and\ninstalled in your system. Anyway, if you have doubts about this, comeback to @sec-build-system.\n\n\n\n## Importing C header files {#sec-import-c-header}\n\nAt @sec-strategy-c, we have described that, currently, there are two different paths that\nyou can take to import a C header file into your Zig modules, `translate-c` or `@cImport()`.\nThis section describes each strategy separately in more details.\n\n### Strategy 1: using `translate-c`\n\nWhen we choose this strategy, we first need to use the `translate-c` tool to translate\nthe C header files that we want to use into Zig code. For example, suppose we wanted to\nuse the `fopen()` C function from the `stdio.h` C header file. We can translate the\n`stdio.h` C header file through the bash command below:\n\n```bash\nzig translate-c /usr/include/stdio.h \\\n    -lc -I/usr/include \\\n    -D_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE=1 > c.zig \\\n```\n\nNotice that, in this bash command, we are passing the necessary compiler flags (`-D` to define macros,\n`-l` to link libraries, `-I` to add an \"include path\") to compile and use the `stdio.h` header file.\nAlso notice that we are saving the results of the translation process inside a Zig module called `c.zig`.\n\nTherefore, after running this command, all we have to do is to import this `c.zig` module, and start\ncalling the C functions that you want to call from it. The example below demonstrates that.\nIs important to remember what we've discussed at @sec-linking-c. In order to compile this\nexample you have to link this code with `libc`, by passing the flag `-lc` to the `zig` compiler.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst c = @import(\"c.zig\");\npub fn main() !void {\n    const x: f32 = 1772.94122;\n    _ = c.printf(\"%.3f\\n\", x);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\n1772.941\n```\n\n\n### Strategy 2: using `@cImport()`\n\nTo import a C header file into our Zig code, we can use the built-in functions `@cInclude()` and `@cImport()`.\nInside the `@cImport()` function, we open a block (with a pair of curly braces). Inside this block\nwe can (if we need to) include multiple `@cDefine()` calls to define C macros when including this specific C header file.\nBut for the most part, you will probably need to use just a single call inside this block,\nwhich is a call to `@cInclude()`.\n\nThis `@cInclude()` function is equivalent to the `#include` statement in C.\nYou provide the name of the C header that you want to include as input to this `@cInclude()` function,\nthen, in conjunction with `@cImport()`, it will perform the necessary steps\nto include this C header file into your Zig code.\n\nYou should bind the result of `@cImport()` to a constant object, pretty much like you would do with\n`@import()`. You just assign the result to a constant object in your\nZig code, and, as consequence, all C functions, C structs, C macros, etc. that are defined inside the\nC header files will be available through this constant object.\n\nLook at the code example below, where we are importing the Standard I/O C Library (`stdio.h`),\nand calling the `printf()`[^printf] C function. Notice that we have also used in this example the C function `powf()`[^powf],\nwhich comes from the C Math Library (`math.h`).\nIn order to compile this example, you have to link this Zig code with both\nthe C Standard Library and the C Math Library, by passing the flags `-lc` and `-lm`\nto the `zig` compiler.\n\n[^printf]: <https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/>\n[^powf]: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/numeric/math/pow>\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst c = @cImport({\n    @cDefine(\"_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE\", \"1\");\n    @cInclude(\"stdio.h\");\n    @cInclude(\"math.h\");\n});\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const x: f32 = 15.2;\n    const y = c.powf(x, @as(f32, 2.6));\n    _ = c.printf(\"%.3f\\n\", y);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\n1182.478\n```\n\n\n## About passing Zig values to C functions {#sec-zig-obj-to-c}\n\nZig objects have some intrinsic differences between their C equivalents.\nProbably the most noticeable one is the difference between C strings and Zig strings,\nwhich I described at @sec-zig-strings.\nZig strings are objects that contains both an array of arbitrary bytes and a length value.\nOn the other hand, a C string is usually just a pointer to a null-terminated array of arbitrary bytes.\n\nBecause of these intrinsic differences, in some specific cases, you cannot pass Zig objects directly\nas inputs to C functions before you convert them into C compatible values. However, in some other cases,\nyou are allowed to pass Zig objects and Zig literal values directly as inputs to C functions,\nand everything will work just fine, because the `zig` compiler will handle everything for you.\n\nSo we have two different scenarios being described here. Let's call them \"auto-conversion\" and \"need-conversion\".\nThe \"auto-conversion\" scenario is when the `zig` compiler handles everything for you, and automatically convert your\nZig objects/values into C compatible values. In contrast,\nthe \"need-conversion\" scenario is when you, the programmer, have the responsibility of converting\nthat Zig object into a C compatible value, before passing it to C code.\n\nThere is also a third scenario that is not being described here, which is when you create a C object, or, a C struct, or\na C compatible value in your Zig code, and you pass this C object/value as input to a C function in your Zig code.\nThis scenario will be described later at @sec-c-inputs. In this section, we are focused on the scenarios where\nwe are passing Zig objects/values to C code, instead of C objects/values being passed to C code.\n\n\n### The \"auto-conversion\" scenario\n\nAn \"auto-conversion\" scenario is when the `zig` compiler automatically converts our Zig objects into\nC compatible values for us. This specific scenario happens mostly in two instances:\n\n- with string literal values;\n- with any of the primitive data types that were introduced at @sec-primitive-data-types.\n\nWhen we think about the second instance described above, the `zig` compiler does automatically\nconvert any of the primitive data types into their C equivalents, because the compiler knows how\nto properly convert a `i16` into a `signed short`, or, a `u8` into a `unsigned char`, etc.\nNow, when we think about string literal values, they can be automatically\nconverted into C strings as well, especially because the `zig` compiler does not forces\na specific Zig data type into a string literal at first glance, unless you store this\nstring literal into a Zig object, and explicitly annotate the data type of this object.\n\nThus, with string literal values, the `zig` compiler have more freedom to infer which is the appropriate data type\nto be used in each situation. You could say that the string literal value \"inherits its data type\" depending on the context that\nit is used. Most of the times, this data type is going to be the type that we commonly associate with Zig strings (`[]const u8`).\nBut it might be a different type depending on the situation. When the `zig` compiler detects that you are providing\na string literal value as input to some C function, the compiler automatically interprets this string\nliteral as a C string value.\n\nAs an example, look at the code exposed below. Here we are using\nthe `fopen()` C function to simply open and close a file. If you do not know how this `fopen()`\nfunction works in C, it takes two C strings as input. But in this code example below, we are passing some\nstring literals written in our Zig code directly as inputs to this `fopen()` C function.\n\nIn other words, we are not doing any conversion from a Zig string to a C string.\nWe are just passing the Zig string literals directly as inputs to the C function. And it works just fine!\nBecause the compiler inteprets the string `\"foo.txt\"` as a C string given the current context.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst c = @cImport({\n    @cDefine(\"_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE\", \"1\");\n    @cInclude(\"stdio.h\");\n});\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const file = c.fopen(\"foo.txt\", \"rb\");\n    if (file == null) {\n        @panic(\"Could not open file!\");\n    }\n    if (c.fclose(file) != 0) {\n        return error.CouldNotCloseFileDescriptor;\n    }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's make some experiments, by writing the same code in different manners, and we\nsee how this affects the program. As a starting point, let's store the `\"foo.txt\"` string inside\na Zig object, like the `path` object below, and then, we pass this Zig object as input to the `fopen()` C function.\n\nIf we do this, the program still compiles and runs successfully. Notice that I have omitted most of the code in this example below.\nThis is just for brevity reasons, because the remainder of the program is still the same.\nThe only difference between this example and the previous one is just these two lines exposed below.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n    const path = \"foo.txt\";\n    const file = c.fopen(path, \"rb\");\n    // Remainder of the program\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, what happens if you give an explicit data type to the `path` object? Well, if I force\nthe `zig` compiler to interpret this `path` object as a Zig string object,\nby annotating the `path` object with the data type `[]const u8`, then, I actually get a compile error\nas demonstrated below. We get this compile error because now I'm forcing the `zig` compiler\nto interpret `path` as a Zig string object.\n\nAccording to the error message, the `fopen()` C function was expecting to receive an\ninput value of type `[*c]const u8` (C string) instead of a value of type `[]const u8` (Zig string).\nIn more details, the type `[*c]const u8` is actually the Zig type representation of a C string.\nThe `[*c]` portion of this type identifies a C pointer. So, this Zig type essentially means: a C pointer to an array (`[*c]`) of\nconstant bytes (`const u8`).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n    const path: []const u8 = \"foo.txt\";\n    const file = c.fopen(path, \"rb\");\n    // Remainder of the program\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\nt.zig:2:7 error: expected type '[*c]const u8', found '[]const u8':\n    const file = c.fopen(path, \"rb\");\n                         ^~~~\n```\n\nTherefore, when we talk exclusively about string literal values, as long as you don't give an\nexplicit data type to these string literal values, the `zig` compiler should be capable of automatically\nconverting them into C strings as needed.\n\nBut what about using one of the primitive data types that were introduced at @sec-primitive-data-types?\nLet's take code exposed below as an example of that. Here, we are giving some float literal values as input\nto the C function `powf()`. Notice that this code example compiles and runs successfully.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\nconst cmath = @cImport({\n    @cInclude(\"math.h\");\n});\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const y = cmath.powf(15.68, 2.32);\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{y});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\n593.2023\n```\n\nOnce again, because the `zig` compiler does not associate a specific data type with the literal values\n`15.68` and `2.32` at first glance, the compiler can automatically convert these values\ninto their C `float` (or `double`) equivalents, before it passes to the `powf()` C function.\nNow, even if I give an explicit Zig data type to these literal values, by storing them into a Zig object,\nand explicit annotating the type of these objects, the code still compiles and runs successfully.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n    const x: f32 = 15.68;\n    const y = cmath.powf(x, 2.32);\n    // The remainder of the program\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\n593.2023\n```\n\n\n\n### The \"need-conversion\" scenario\n\nA \"need-conversion\" scenario is when we need to manually convert our Zig objects into C compatible values\nbefore passing them as input to C functions. You will fall in this scenario, when passing Zig string objects\nto C functions.\n\nWe have already seen this specific circumstance in the last `fopen()` example,\nwhich is reproduced below. You can see in this example, that we have given an explicit Zig data type\n(`[]const u8`) to our `path` object, and, as a consequence of that, we have forced the `zig` compiler\nto see this `path` object, as a Zig string object. Therefore, we need now to manually convert\nthis `path` object into a C string before we pass it to `fopen()`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n    const path: []const u8 = \"foo.txt\";\n    const file = c.fopen(path, \"rb\");\n    // Remainder of the program\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\nt.zig:10:26: error: expected type '[*c]const u8', found '[]const u8'\n    const file = c.fopen(path, \"rb\");\n                         ^~~~\n```\n\n\nThere are different ways to convert a Zig string object into a C string.\nOne way to solve this problem is to provide the pointer to the underlying array\nof bytes, instead of providing the Zig object directly as input.\nYou can access this pointer by using the `ptr` property of the Zig string object.\n\nThe code example below demonstrates this strategy. Notice that, by giving the\npointer to the underlying array in `path` through the `ptr` property, we get no compile errors as result\nwhile using the `fopen()` C function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n    const path: []const u8 = \"foo.txt\";\n    const file = c.fopen(path.ptr, \"rb\");\n    // Remainder of the program\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis strategy works because this pointer to the underlying array found in the `ptr` property,\nis semantically identical to a C pointer to a null-terminated array of bytes, i.e. a C object of type `*unsigned char`.\nThis is why this option also solves the problem of converting the Zig string into a C string.\n\nAnother option is to explicitly convert the Zig string object into a C pointer by using the\nbuilt-in function `@ptrCast()`. With this function we can convert\nan object of type `[]const u8` into an object of type `[*c]const u8`.\nAs I described at the previous section, the `[*c]` portion of the type\nmeans that it is a C pointer. This strategy is not-recommended. But it is\nuseful to demonstrate the use of `@ptrCast()`.\n\nYou may recall of `@as()` and `@ptrCast()` from @sec-type-cast. Just as a recap,\nthe `@as()` built-in function is used to explicitly convert (or cast) a Zig value\nfrom a type \"x\" into a value of type \"y\". But in our case here, we are converting\na pointer object. Everytime a pointer is involved in some \"type casting operation\" in Zig,\nthe `@ptrCast()` function is involved.\n\nIn the example below, we are using this function to cast our `path` object\ninto a C pointer to an array of bytes. Then, we pass this C pointer as input\nto the `fopen()` function. Notice that this code example compiles successfully\nwith no errors.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n    const path: []const u8 = \"foo.txt\";\n    const c_path: [*c]const u8 = @ptrCast(path);\n    const file = c.fopen(c_path, \"rb\");\n    // Remainder of the program\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Creating C objects in Zig {#sec-c-inputs}\n\nCreating C objects, or, in other words, creating instances of C structs in your Zig code\nis actually something quite easy to do. You first need to import the C header file (like I described at @sec-import-c-header) that defines\nthe C struct that you are trying to instantiate in your Zig code. After that, you can just\ncreate a new object in your Zig code, and annotate it with the data type of the C struct.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a C header file called `user.h`, and that this header file is declaring a new struct named `User`.\nThis C header file is exposed below:\n\n```c\n#include <stdint.h>\n\ntypedef struct {\n    uint64_t id;\n    char* name;\n} User;\n```\n\nThis `User` C struct have two distinct fields, or two struct members, named `id` and `name`.\nThe field `id` is an unsigned 64-bit integer value, while the field `name` is just a standard C string.\nNow, suppose that I want to create an instance of this `User` struct in my Zig code.\nI can do that by importing this `user.h` header file into my Zig code, and creating\na new object with type `User`. These steps are reproduced in the code example below.\n\nNotice that I have used the keyword `undefined` in this example. This allows me to\ncreate the `new_user` object without the need to provide an initial value to the object.\nAs consequence, the underlying memory associated with this `new_user` object is unintialized,\ni.e. the memory is currently populated with \"garbage\" values.\nThus, this expression have the exact same effect of the expression `User new_user;` in C,\nwhich means \"declare a new object named `new_user` of type `User`\".\n\nIs our responsibility to properly initialize this memory associated with this `new_user` object,\nby assigning valid values to the members (or the fields) of the C struct. In the example below,\nI'm assigning the integer 1 to the member `id`. I am also saving the string `\"pedropark99\"` into the member `name`.\nNotice in this example that I manually add the null character (zero byte) to the end of the allocated array\nfor this string. This null character marks the end of the array in C.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\nconst c = @cImport({\n    @cInclude(\"user.h\");\n});\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    var new_user: c.User = undefined;\n    new_user.id = 1;\n    var user_name = try allocator.alloc(u8, 12);\n    defer allocator.free(user_name);\n    @memcpy(user_name[0..(user_name.len - 1)], \"pedropark99\");\n    user_name[user_name.len - 1] = 0;\n    new_user.name = user_name.ptr;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nSo, in this example above, we are manually initializing each field of the C struct.\nWe could say that, in this instance, we are \"manually instantiating\nthe C struct object\". However, when we use C libraries in our Zig code, we rarely need\nto manually instantiate the C structs like that. Only because C libraries\nusually provide a \"constructor function\" in their public APIs. As consequence, we normally rely on\nthese constructor functions to properly initialize the C structs, and\nthe struct fields for us.\n\nFor example, consider the Harfbuzz C library. This a text shaping C library,\nand it works around a \"buffer object\", or, more specifically, an instance of\nthe C struct `hb_buffer_t`. Therefore, we need to create an instance of\nthis C struct if we want to use this C library. Luckily, this library offers\nthe function `hb_buffer_create()`, which we can use to create such object.\nSo the Zig code necessary to create such object would probably look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst c = @cImport({\n    @cInclude(\"hb.h\");\n});\nvar buf: c.hb_buffer_t = c.hb_buffer_create();\n// Do stuff with the \"buffer object\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we do not need to manually create an instance of the C struct\n`hb_buffer_t` here, and manually assign valid values to each field in this C struct.\nBecause the constructor function `hb_buffer_create()` is doing this heavy job for us.\n\nSince this `buf` object, and also, the `new_user` object from previous examples, are instances of C structs, these\nobjects are by themselves C compatible values. They are C objects defined in our Zig code. As consequence,\nyou can freely pass these objects as input to any C function that expects to receive this type\nof C struct as input. You do not need to use any special syntax, or, to convert them in\nany special manner to use them in C code. This is how we create and use C objects in our Zig code.\n\n\n\n## Passing C structs across Zig functions {#sec-pass-c-structs}\n\nNow that we have learned how to create/declare C objects in our Zig code, we\nneed to learn how to pass these C objects as inputs to Zig functions.\nAs I described at @sec-c-inputs, we can freely pass these C objects as inputs to C code\nthat we call from our Zig code. But what about passing these C objects to Zig functions?\n\nIn essence, this specific case requires one small adjustment in the Zig function declaration.\nAll you need to do, is to make sure that you pass your C object *by reference* to the function,\ninstead of passing it *by value*. To do that, you have to annotate the data type of the function argument\nthat is receiving this C object as \"a pointer to the C struct\", instead of annotating it as \"an instance of the C struct\".\n\nLet's consider the C struct `User` from the `user.h` C header file that we have used at @sec-c-inputs.\nNow, consider that we want to create a Zig function that sets the value of the `id` field\nin this C struct, like the `set_user_id()` function declared below.\nNotice that the `user` argument in this function is annotated as a pointer (`*`) to a `c.User` object.\n\nTherefore, all you have to do when passing C objects to Zig functions, is to add `*` to the\ndata type of the function argument that is receiving the C object. This will make sure that\nthe C object is passed *by reference* to the function.\n\nBecause we have transformed the function argument into a pointer,\neverytime that you have to access the value pointed by this input pointer inside the function body, for whatever reason (e.g. you want\nto read, update, or delete this value), you have to dereference the pointer with the `.*` syntax that we\nlearned from @sec-pointer. Notice that the `set_user_id()` function is using this syntax to alter\nthe value in the `id` field of the `User` struct pointed by the input pointer.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\nconst c = @cImport({\n    @cInclude(\"user.h\");\n});\nfn set_user_id(id: u64, user: *c.User) void {\n    user.*.id = id;\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n\n    var new_user: c.User = undefined;\n    new_user.id = 1;\n    var user_name = try allocator.alloc(u8, 12);\n    defer allocator.free(user_name);\n    @memcpy(user_name[0..(user_name.len - 1)], \"pedropark99\");\n    user_name[user_name.len - 1] = 0;\n    new_user.name = user_name.ptr;\n\n    set_user_id(25, &new_user);\n    try stdout.print(\"New ID: {any}\\n\", .{new_user.id});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n```\nNew ID: 25\n```\n\n",
