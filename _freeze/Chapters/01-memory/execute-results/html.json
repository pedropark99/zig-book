How does Zig controls memory? What\ncommon tools are used? Are there any important aspect that makes memory\ndifferent/special in Zig? You will find the answers here.\n\nComputers fundamentally rely on memory to function. This memory acts as a temporary storage\nspace for the data and values generated during computations. Without memory, the core\nconcepts of \"variables\" and \"objects\" in programming languages would be impossible.\n\n\n\n\n## Memory spaces\n\nEvery object that you create in your Zig source code needs to be stored somewhere,\nin your computer's memory. Depending on where and how you define your object, Zig\nwill use a different \"memory space\", or a different\ntype of memory to store this object.\n\nEach type of memory normally serves for different purposes.\nIn Zig, there are 3 types of memory (or 3 different memory spaces) that we care about. They are:\n\n- Global data register (or the \"global data section\");\n- Stack;\n- Heap;\n\n\n### Compile-time known versus runtime known {#sec-compile-time}\n\nOne strategy that Zig uses to decide where it will store each object that you declare, is by looking\nat the value of this particular object. More specifically, by investigating if this value is\nknown at \"compile-time\" or at \"runtime\".\n\nWhen you write a program in Zig, the values of some of the objects that you write in your program are *known\nat compile time*. Meaning that, when you compile your Zig source code, during the compilation process,\nthe `zig` compiler can figure it out what is the exact value of a particular object\nthat exists in your source code.\nKnowing the length (or the size) of each object is also important. So the length (or the size) of each object that you write in your program is,\nin some cases, *known at compile time*.\n\nThe `zig` compiler cares more about knowing the length (or the size) of a particular object\n, than to know its actual value. But, if the `zig` compiler knows the value of the object, then, it\nautomatically knows the size of this object. Because it can simply calculate the\nsize of the object by looking at the size of the value.\n\nTherefore, the priority for the `zig` compiler is to discover the size of each object in your source code.\nIf the value of the object in question is known at compile-time, then, the `zig` compiler\nautomatically knows the size/length of this object. But if the value of this object is not\nknown at compile-time, then, the size of this object is only known at compile-time if,\nand only if, the type of this object have a known fixed size.\n\nIn order to a type have a known fixed size, this type must have data members whose size is fixed.\nIf this type includes, for example, a variable sized array in it, then, this type do not have a known\nfixed size. Because this array can have any size at runtime\n(i.e. it can be an array of 2 elements, or 50 elements, or 1 thousand elements, etc.).\n\nFor example, a string object, which internally is an array of constant u8 values (`[]const u8`)\nhave a variable size. It can be a string object with 100 or 500 characters in it. If we do not\nknow at compile-time, which exact string will be stored inside this string object, then, we cannot calculate\nthe size of this string object at compile-time. So, any type, or any struct declaration that you make, that\nincludes a string data member that do not have an explicit fixed size, makes this type, or this\nnew struct that you are declaring, a type that do not have a known fixed size at compile-time.\n\nIn contrast, if the type or this struct that you are declaring, includes a data member that is an array,\nbut this array have a known fixed size, like `[60]u8` (which declares an array of 60 `u8` values), then,\nthis type, or, this struct that you are declaring, becomes a type with a known fixed size at compile-time.\nAnd because of that, in this case, the `zig` compiler do not need to known at compile-time the exact value of\nany object of this type. Since the compiler can find the necessary size to store this object by\nlooking at the size of its type.\n\n\nLet's look at an example. In the source code below, we have two constant objects (`name` and `array`) declared.\nBecause the values of these particular objects are written down, in the source code itself (`\"Pedro\"`\nand the number sequence from 1 to 4), the `zig` compiler can easily discover the values of these constant\nobjects (`name` and `array`) during the compilation process.\nThis is what \"known at compile time\" means. It refers to any object that you have in your Zig source code\nwhose value can be identified at compile time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst name = \"Pedro\";\nconst array = [_]u8{1, 2, 3, 4};\n_ = name; _ = array;\n\nfn input_length(input: []const u8) usize {\n    const n = input.len;\n    return n;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other side of the spectrum are objects whose values are not known at compile time.\nFunction arguments are a classic example of this. Because the value of each function\nargument depends on the value that you assign to this particular argument,\nwhen you call the function.\n\nFor example, the function `input_length()` contains an argument named `input`, which is an array of constant `u8` integers (`[]const u8`).\nIs impossible to know at compile time the value of this particular argument. And it also is impossible to know the size/length\nof this particular argument. Because it is an array that do not have a fixed size specified explicitly in the argument type annotation.\n\nSo, we know that this `input` argument will be an array of `u8` integers. But we do not know at compile-time, its value, and neither his size.\nThis information is known only at runtime, which is the period of time when you program is executed.\nAs a consequence, the value of the expression `input.len` is also known only at runtime.\nThis is an intrinsic characteristic of any function. Just remember that the value of function arguments is usually not \"compile-time known\".\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, what really matters to the compiler is to know the size of the object\nat compile-time, and not necessarily its value. So, although we don't know the value of the object `n`, which is the result of the expression\n`input.len`, at compile-time, we do know its size. Because the expression `input.len` always return a value of type `usize`,\nand the type `usize` have a known fixed size.\n\n\n\n### Global data register\n\nThe global data register is a specific section of the executable of your Zig program, that is responsible\nfor storing any value that is known at compile time.\n\nEvery constant object whose value is known at compile time that you declare in your source code,\nis stored in the global data register. Also, every literal value that you write in your source code,\nsuch as the string `\"this is a string\"`, or the integer `10`, or a boolean value such as `true`,\nis also stored in the global data register.\n\nHonestly, you don't need to care much about this memory space. Because you can't control it,\nyou can't deliberately access it or use it for your own purposes.\nAlso, this memory space does not affect the logic of your program.\nIt simply exists in your program.\n\n\n### Stack vs Heap\n\nIf you are familiar with system's programming, or just low-level programming in general, you\nprobably have heard of the \"duel\" between Stack vs Heap. These are two different types of memory,\nor different memory spaces, which are both available in Zig.\n\nThese two types of memory don't actually duel with\neach other. This is a common mistake that beginners have, when seeing \"x vs y\" styles of\ntabloid headlines. These two types of memory are actually complementary to each other.\nSo, in almost every Zig program that you ever write, you will likely use a combination of both.\nI will describe each memory space in detail over the next sections. But for now, I just want to\nstablish the main difference between these two types of memory.\n\nIn essence, the stack memory is normally used to store values whose length is fixed and known\nat compile time. In contrast, the heap memory is a *dynamic* type of memory space, meaning that, it is\nused to store values whose length might grow during the execution (runtime) of your program [@jenny2022].\n\nLengths that grow during runtime are intrinsically associated with \"runtime known\" type of values.\nIn other words, if you have an object whose length might grow during runtime, then, the length\nof this object becomes not known at compile time. If the length is not known at compile-time,\nthe value of this object also becomes not known at compile-time.\nThese types of objects should be stored in the heap memory space, which is\na dynamic memory space, which can grow or shrink to fit the size of your objects.\n\n\n\n### Stack {#sec-stack}\n\nThe stack is a type of memory that uses the power of the *stack data structure*, hence the name. \nA \"stack\" is a type of *data structure* that uses a \"last in, first out\" (LIFO) mechanism to store the values\nyou give it to. I imagine you are familiar with this data structure.\nBut, if you are not, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))[^wiki-stack]\n, or, the [Geeks For Geeks page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/)[^geek-stack] are both\nexcellent and easy resources to fully understand how this data structure works.\n\n[^wiki-stack]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>\n[^geek-stack]: <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/>\n\nSo, the stack memory space is a type of memory that stores values using a stack data structure.\nIt adds and removes values from the memory by following a \"last in, first out\" (LIFO) principle.\n\nEvery time you make a function call in Zig, an amount of space in the stack is\nreserved for this particular function call [@jenny2022; @zigdocs].\nThe value of each function argument given to the function in this function call is stored in this\nstack space. Also, every local object that you declare inside the function scope is\nusually stored in this same stack space.\n\n\nLooking at the example below, the object `result` is a local object declared inside the scope of the `add()`\nfunction. Because of that, this object is stored inside the stack space reserved for the `add()` function.\nThe `r` object (which is declared outside of the `add()` function scope) is also stored in the stack.\nBut since it is declared in the \"outer\" scope, this object is stored in the\nstack space that belongs to this outer scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst r = add(5, 27);\n_ = r;\n\nfn add(x: u8, y: u8) u8 {\n    const result = x + y;\n    return result;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, any object that you declare inside the scope of a function is always stored inside\nthe space that was reserved for that particular function in the stack memory. This\nalso counts for any object declared inside the scope of your `main()` function for example.\nAs you would expect, in this case, they\nare stored inside the stack space reserved for the `main()` function.\n\nOne very important detail about the stack memory is that **it frees itself automatically**.\nThis is very important, remember that. When objects are stored in the stack memory,\nyou don't have the work (or the responsibility) of freeing/destroying these objects.\nBecause they will be automatically destroyed once the stack space is freed at the end of the function scope.\n\nSo, once the function call returns (or ends, if you prefer to call it this way)\nthe space that was reserved in the stack is destroyed, and all of the objects that were in that space goes away with it.\nThis mechanism exists because this space, and the objects within it, are not necessary anymore,\nsince the function \"finished its business\".\nUsing the `add()` function that we exposed above as an example, it means that the object `result` is automatically\ndestroyed once the function returns.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nLocal objects that are stored in the stack space of a function are automatically\nfreed/destroyed at the end of the function scope.\n:::\n\n\nThis same logic applies to any other special structure in Zig that have its own scope by surrounding\nit with curly braces (`{}`).\nFor loops, while loops, if else statements, etc. For example, if you declare any local\nobject in the scope of a for loop, this local object is accessible only within the scope\nof this particular for loop. Because once the scope of this for loop ends, the space in the stack\nreserved for this for loop is freed.\nThe example below demonstrates this idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// This does not compile successfully!\nconst a = [_]u8{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};\nfor (0..a.len) |i| {\n    const index = i;\n    _ = index;\n}\n// Trying to use an object that was\n// declared in the for loop scope,\n// and that does not exist anymore.\nstd.debug.print(\"{d}\\n\", index);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important consequence of this mechanism is that, once the function returns, you can no longer access any memory\naddress that was inside the space in the stack reserved for this particular function. Because this space was\ndestroyed. This means that, if this local object is stored in the stack,\nyou cannot make a function that **returns a pointer to this object**.\n\nThink about that for a second. If all local objects in the stack are destroyed at the end of the function scope, why\nwould you even consider returning a pointer to one of these objects? This pointer is at best,\ninvalid, or, more likely, \"undefined\".\n\nConclusion, is totally fine to write a function that returns the local object\nitself as result, because then, you return the value of that object as the result.\nBut, if this local object is stored in the stack, you should never write a function\nthat returns a pointer to this local object. Because the memory address pointed by the pointer\nno longer exists.\n\n\nSo, using again the `add()` function as an example, if you rewrite this function so that it\nreturns a pointer to the local object `result`, the `zig` compiler will actually compile\nyou program, with no warnings or erros. At first glance, it looks that this is good code\nthat works as expected. But this is a lie!\n\nIf you try to take a look at the value inside of the `r` object,\nor, if you try to use this `r` object in another expression\nor function call, then, you would have undefined behaviour, and major\nbugs in your program [@zigdocs, see \"Lifetime and Ownership\"[^life] and \"Undefined Behaviour\"[^undef] sections].\n\n[^life]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Lifetime-and-Ownership>\n[^undef]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// This code compiles successfully. But it has\n// undefined behaviour. Never do this!!!\n\n// The `r` object is undefined!\nconst r = add(5, 27);\n_ = r;\n\nfn add(x: u8, y: u8) *const u8 {\n    const result = x + y;\n    return &result;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \"invalid pointer to stack variable\" problem is very known across many programming language communities.\nIf you try to do the same thing, for example, in a C or C++ program (i.e. returning an address to\na local object stored in the stack), you would also get undefined behaviour\nin the program.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nIf a local object in your function is stored in the stack, you should never\nreturn a pointer to this local object from the function. Because\nthis pointer will always become undefined after the function returns, since the stack space of the function\nis destroyed at the end of its scope.\n:::\n\nBut what if you really need to use this local object in some way after your function returns?\nHow can you do this? The answer is: \"in the same you would do if this was a C or C++ program. By returning\nan address to an object stored in the heap\". The heap memory have a much more flexible lifecycle,\nand allows you to get a valid pointer to a local object of a function that already returned\nfrom its scope.\n\n\n### Heap {#sec-heap}\n\nOne important limitation of the stack, is that, only objects whose length/size is known at compile-time can be\nstored in it. In contrast, the heap is a much more dynamic\n(and flexible) type of memory. It is the perfect type of memory to use\non objects whose size/length might grow during the execution of your program.\n\nVirtually any application that behaves as a server is a classic use case of the heap.\nA HTTP server, a SSH server, a DNS server, a LSP server, ... any type of server.\nIn summary, a server is a type of application that runs for long periods of time,\nand that serves (or \"deals with\") any incoming request that reaches this particular server.\n\nThe heap is a good choice for this type of system, mainly because the server does not know upfront\nhow many requests it will receive from users, while it is active. It could be one single request,\nor, 5 thousand requests, or, it could also be zero requests.\nThe server needs to have the ability to allocate and manage its memory according to how many requests it receives.\n\nAnother key difference between the stack and the heap, is that the heap is a type\nof memory that you, the programmer, have complete control over. This makes the heap a\nmore flexible type of memory, but it also makes it harder to work with it. Because you,\nthe programmer, is responsible for managing everything related to it. Including where the memory is allocated,\nhow much memory is allocated, and where this memory is freed.\n\n> Unlike stack memory, heap memory is allocated explicitly by programmers and it won’t be deallocated until it is explicitly freed [@jenny2022].\n\nTo store an object in the heap, you, the programmer, needs to explicitly tells Zig to do so,\nby using an allocator to allocate some space in the heap. At @sec-allocators, I will present how you can use allocators to allocate memory\nin Zig.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nEvery memory you allocate in the heap needs to be explicitly freed by you, the programmer.\n:::\n\nThe majority of allocators in Zig do allocate memory on the heap. But some exceptions to this rule are\n`ArenaAllocator()` and `FixedBufferAllocator()`. The `ArenaAllocator()` is a special\ntype of allocator that works in conjunction with a second type of allocator.\nOn the other side, the `FixedBufferAllocator()` is an allocator that works based on\nbuffer objects created on the stack. This means that the `FixedBufferAllocator()` makes\nallocations only on the stack.\n\n\n\n\n### Summary\n\nAfter discussing all of these boring details, we can quickly recap what we learned.\nIn summary, the Zig compiler will use the following rules to decide where each\nobject you declare is stored:\n\n1. every literal value (such as `\"this is string\"`, `10`, or `true`) is stored in the global data section.\n1. every constant object (`const`) whose value **is known at compile-time** is also stored in the global data section.\n1. every object (constant or not) whose length/size **is known at compile time** is stored in the stack space for the current scope.\n1. if an object is created with the method `alloc()` or `create()` of an allocator object, this object is stored in the memory space used by this particular allocator object. Most of allocators available in Zig use the heap memory, so, this object is likely stored in the heap (`FixedBufferAllocator()` is an exception to that).\n1. the heap can only be accessed through allocators. If your object was not created through the `alloc()` or `create()` methods of an allocator object, then, he is most certainly not an object stored in the heap.\n\n\n## Allocators {#sec-allocators}\n\nOne key aspect about Zig, is that there are \"no hidden-memory allocations\" in Zig.\nWhat that really means, is that \"no allocations happen behind your back in the standard library\" [@zigguide].\n\nThis is a known problem, especially in C++. Because in C++, there are some operators that do allocate\nmemory behind the scene, and there is no way for you to known that, until you actually read the\nsource code of these operators, and find the memory allocation calls.\nMany programmers find this behaviour annoying and hard to keep track of.\n\nBut, in Zig, if a function, an operator, or anything from the standard library\nneeds to allocate some memory during its execution, then, this function/operator needs to receive (as input) an allocator\nprovided by the user, to actually be able to allocate the memory it needs.\n\nThis creates a clear distinction between functions that \"do not\" from those that \"actually do\"\nallocate memory. Just look at the arguments of this function.\nIf a function, or operator, have an allocator object as one of its inputs/arguments, then, you know for\nsure that this function/operator will allocate some memory during its execution.\n\nAn example is the `allocPrint()` function from the Zig standard library. With this function, you can\nwrite a new string using format specifiers. So, this function is, for example, very similar to the function `sprintf()` in C.\nIn order to write such new string, the `allocPrint()` function needs to allocate some memory to store the\noutput string.\n\nThat is why, the first argument of this function is an allocator object that you, the user/programmer, gives\nas input to the function. In the example below, I am using the `GeneralPurposeAllocator()` as my allocator\nobject. But I could easily use any other type of allocator object from the Zig standard library.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\nconst allocator = gpa.allocator();\nconst name = \"Pedro\";\nconst output = try std.fmt.allocPrint(\n    allocator,\n    \"Hello {s}!!!\",\n    .{name}\n);\ntry stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{output});\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nHello Pedro!!!\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get a lot of control\nover where and how much memory this function can allocate. Because it is you,\nthe user/programmer, that provides the allocator for the function to use.\nThis makes \"total control\" over memory management easier to achieve in Zig.\n\n### What are allocators?\n\nAllocators in Zig are objects that you can use to allocate memory for your program.\nThey are similar to the memory allocating functions in C, like `malloc()` and `calloc()`.\nSo, if you need to use more memory than you initially have, during the execution of your program, you can simply ask\nfor more memory using an allocator.\n\nZig offers different types of allocators, and they are usually available through the `std.heap` module of\nthe standard library. So, just import the Zig standard library into your Zig module (with `@import(\"std\")`), and you can start\nusing these allocators in your code.\n\nFurthermore, every allocator object is built on top of the `Allocator` interface in Zig. This\nmeans that, every allocator object you find in Zig must have the methods `alloc()`,\n`create()`, `free()` and `destroy()`. So, you can change the type of allocator you are using,\nbut you don't need to change the function calls to the methods that do the memory allocation\n(and the free memory operations) for your program.\n\n### Why you need an allocator?\n\nAs we described at @sec-stack, everytime you make a function call in Zig,\na space in the stack is reserved for this function call. But the stack\nhave a key limitation which is: every object stored in the stack have a\nknown fixed length.\n\nBut in reality, there are two very common instances where this \"fixed length limitation\" of the stack is a deal braker:\n\n1. the objects that you create inside your function might grow in size during the execution of the function.\n1. sometimes, it is impossible to know upfront how many inputs you will receive, or how big this input will be.\n\nAlso, there is another instance where you might want to use an allocator, which is when you want to write a function that returns a pointer\nto a local object. As I described at @sec-stack, you cannot do that if this local object is stored in the\nstack. However, if this object is stored in the heap, then, you can return a pointer to this object at the\nend of the function. Because you (the programmer) control the lyfetime of any heap memory that you allocate. You decide\nwhen this memory get's destroyed/freed.\n\nThese are common situations where the stack is not good for.\nThat is why you need a different memory management strategy to\nstore these objects inside your function. You need to use\na memory type that can grow together with your objects, or that you\ncan control the lyfetime of this memory.\nThe heap fit this description.\n\nAllocating memory on the heap is commonly known as dynamic memory management. As the objects you create grow in size\nduring the execution of your program, you grow the amount of memory\nyou have by allocating more memory in the heap to store these objects. \nAnd you that in Zig, by using an allocator object.\n\n\n### The different types of allocators\n\n\nAt the moment of the writing of this book, in Zig, we have 6 different\nallocators available in the standard library:\n\n- `GeneralPurposeAllocator()`.\n- `page_allocator()`.\n- `FixedBufferAllocator()` and `ThreadSafeFixedBufferAllocator()`.\n- `ArenaAllocator()`.\n- `c_allocator()` (requires you to link to libc).\n\n\nEach allocator have its own perks and limitations. All allocators, except `FixedBufferAllocator()` and `ArenaAllocator()`,\nare allocators that use the heap memory. So any memory that you allocate with\nthese allocators, will be placed in the heap.\n\n### General-purpose allocators\n\nThe `GeneralPurposeAllocator()`, as the name suggests, is a \"general purpose\" allocator. You can use it for every type\nof task. In the example below, I'm allocating enough space to store a single integer in the object `some_number`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n    const some_number = try allocator.create(u32);\n    defer allocator.destroy(some_number);\n\n    some_number.* = @as(u32, 45);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile useful, you might want to use the `c_allocator()`, which is a alias to the C standard allocator `malloc()`. So, yes, you can use\n`malloc()` in Zig if you want to. Just use the `c_allocator()` from the Zig standard library. However,\nif you do use `c_allocator()`, you must link to Libc when compiling your source code with the\n`zig` compiler, by including the flag `-lc` in your compilation process.\nIf you do not link your source code to Libc, Zig will not be able to find the\n`malloc()` implementation in your system.\n\n### Page allocator\n\nThe `page_allocator()` is an allocator that allocates full pages of memory in the heap. In other words,\nevery time you allocate memory with `page_allocator()`, a full page of memory in the heap is allocated,\ninstead of just a small piece of it.\n\nThe size of this page depends on the system you are using.\nMost systems use a page size of 4KB in the heap, so, that is the amount of memory that is normally\nallocated in each call by `page_allocator()`. That is why, `page_allocator()` is considered a\nfast, but also \"wasteful\" allocator in Zig. Because it allocates a big amount of memory\nin each call, and you most likely will not need that much memory in your program.\n\n### Buffer allocators\n\nThe `FixedBufferAllocator()` and `ThreadSafeFixedBufferAllocator()` are allocator objects that\nwork with a fixed sized buffer that is stored in the stack. So these two allocators only allocates\nmemory in the stack. This also means that, in order to use these allocators, you must first\ncreate a buffer object, and then, give this buffer as an input to these allocators.\n\nIn the example below, I am creating a `buffer` object that is 10 elements long.\nNotice that I give this `buffer` object to the `FixedBufferAllocator()` constructor.\nNow, because this `buffer` object is 10 elements long, this means that I am limited to this space.\nI cannot allocate more than 10 elements with this allocator object. If I try to\nallocate more than that, the `alloc()` method will return an `OutOfMemory` error value.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar buffer: [10]u8 = undefined;\nfor (0..buffer.len) |i| {\n    buffer[i] = 0; // Initialize to zero\n}\n\nvar fba = std.heap.FixedBufferAllocator.init(&buffer);\nconst allocator = fba.allocator();\nconst input = try allocator.alloc(u8, 5);\ndefer allocator.free(input);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Arena allocator {#sec-arena-allocator}\n\nThe `ArenaAllocator()` is an allocator object that takes a child allocator as input. The idea behind the `ArenaAllocator()` in Zig\nis similar to the concept of \"arenas\" in the programming language Go[^go-arena]. It is an allocator object that allows you\nto allocate memory as many times you want, but free all memory only once.\nIn other words, if you have, for example, called 5 times the method `alloc()` of an `ArenaAllocator()` object, you can\nfree all the memory you allocated over these 5 calls at once, by simply calling the `deinit()` method of the same `ArenaAllocator()` object.\n\n[^go-arena]: <https://go.dev/src/arena/arena.go>\n\nIf you give, for example, a `GeneralPurposeAllocator()` object as input to the `ArenaAllocator()` constructor, like in the example below, then, the allocations\nyou perform with `alloc()` will actually be made with the underlying object `GeneralPurposeAllocator()` that was passed.\nSo, with an arena allocator, any new memory you ask for is allocated by the child allocator. The only thing that an arena allocator\nreally do is helping you to free all the memory you allocated multiple times with just a single command. In the example\nbelow, I called `alloc()` 3 times. So, if I did not used an arena allocator, then, I would need to call\n`free()` 3 times to free all the allocated memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\nvar aa = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(gpa.allocator());\ndefer aa.deinit();\nconst allocator = aa.allocator();\n\nconst in1 = allocator.alloc(u8, 5);\nconst in2 = allocator.alloc(u8, 10);\nconst in3 = allocator.alloc(u8, 15);\n_ = in1; _ = in2; _ = in3;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### The `alloc()` and `free()` methods\n\nIn the code example below, we are accessing the `stdin`, which is\nthe standard input channel, to receive an input from the\nuser. We read the input given by the user with the `readUntilDelimiterOrEof()`\nmethod.\n\nNow, after reading the input of the user, we need to store this input somewhere in\nour program. That is why I use an allocator in this example. I use it to allocate some\namount of memory to store this input given by the user. More specifically, the method `alloc()`\nof the allocator object is used to allocate an array capable of storing 50 `u8` values.\n\nNotice that this `alloc()` method receives two inputs. The first one, is a type.\nThis defines what type of values the allocated array will store. In the example\nbelow, we are allocating an array of unsigned 8-bit integers (`u8`). But\nyou can create an array to store any type of value you want. Next, on the second argument, we\ndefine the size of the allocated array, by specifying how much elements\nthis array will contain. In the case below, we are allocating an array of 50 elements.\n\nAt @sec-zig-strings we described that strings in Zig are simply arrays of characters.\nEach character is represented by an `u8` value. So, this means that the array that\nwas allocated in the object `input` is capable of storing a string that is\n50-characters long.\n\nSo, in essence, the expression `var input: [50]u8 = undefined` would create\nan array for 50 `u8` values in the stack of the current scope. But, you\ncan allocate the same array in the heap by using the expression `var input = try allocator.alloc(u8, 50)`.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdin = std.io.getStdIn();\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n    var input = try allocator.alloc(u8, 50);\n    defer allocator.free(input);\n    for (0..input.len) |i| {\n        input[i] = 0; // initialize all fields to zero.\n    }\n    // read user input\n    const input_reader = stdin.reader();\n    _ = try input_reader.readUntilDelimiterOrEof(\n        input,\n        '\\n'\n    );\n    std.debug.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{input});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, notice that in this example, we use the `defer` keyword (which I described at @sec-defer) to run a small\npiece of code at the end of the current scope, which is the expression `allocator.free(input)`.\nWhen you execute this expression, the allocator will free the memory that it allocated\nfor the `input` object.\n\nWe have talked about this at @sec-heap. You **should always** explicitly free any memory that you allocate\nusing an allocator! You do that by using the `free()` method of the same allocator object you\nused to allocate this memory. The `defer` keyword is used in this example only to help us execute\nthis free operation at the end of the current scope.\n\n\n### The `create()` and `destroy()` methods\n\nWith the `alloc()` and `free()` methods, you can allocate memory to store multiple elements\nat once. In other words, with these methods, we always allocate an array to store multiple elements at once.\nBut what if you need enough space to store just a single item? Should you\nallocate an array of a single element through `alloc()`?\n\nThe answer is no! In this case,\nyou should use the `create()` method of the allocator object.\nEvery allocator object offers the `create()` and `destroy()` methods,\nwhich are used to allocate and free memory for a single item, respectively.\n\nSo, in essence, if you want to allocate memory to store an array of elements, you\nshould use `alloc()` and `free()`. But if you need to store just a single item,\nthen, the `create()` and `destroy()` methods are ideal for you.\n\nIn the example below, I'm defining a struct to represent an user of some sort.\nIt could be an user for a game, or a software to manage resources, it doesn't mater.\nNotice that I use the `create()` method this time, to store a single `User` object\nin the program. Also notice that I use the `destroy()` method to free the memory\nused by this object at the end of the scope.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst User = struct {\n    id: usize,\n    name: []const u8,\n\n    pub fn init(id: usize, name: []const u8) User {\n        return .{ .id = id, .name = name };\n    }\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n    const user = try allocator.create(User);\n    defer allocator.destroy(user);\n\n    user.* = User.init(0, \"Pedro\");\n}\n```\n:::\n",
