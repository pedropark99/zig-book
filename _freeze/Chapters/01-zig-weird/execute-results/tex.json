Some programmers interpret\nZig as the \"modern C language\". It is a simple language like C, but with some\nmodern features.\n\nIn the author's personal interpretation, Zig is tightly connected with \"less is more\".\nInstead of trying to become a modern language by adding more and more features,\nmany of the core improvements that Zig brings to the\ntable are actually about removing annoying and evil behaviours/features from C and C++.\nIn other words, Zig tries to be better by simplifying the language, and by having more consistent and robust behaviour.\nAs a result, analyzing, writing and debugging applications become much easier and simpler in Zig, than it is in C or C++.\n\nThis philosophy becomes clear with the following phrase from the official website of Zig:\n\n> \"Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge\".\n\nThis phrase is specially true for C++ programmers. Because C++ is a gigantic language,\nwith tons of features, and also, there are lots of different \"flavors of C++\". These elements\nare what makes C++ so much complex and hard to learn. Zig tries to go in the opposite direction.\nZig is a very simple language, more closely related to other simple languages such as C and Go.\n\nThe phrase above is still important for C programmers too. Because, even C being a simple\nlanguage, it is still hard sometimes to read and understand C code. For example, pre-processor macros in\nC are an evil source of confusion. They really makes it hard sometimes to debug\nC programs. Because macros are essentially a second language embedded in C that obscures\nyour C code. With macros, you are no longer 100% sure about which pieces\nof code are being sent to the compiler. It obscures the actual source code that you wrote.\n\nYou don't have macros in Zig. In Zig, the code you write, is the actual code that get's compiled by the compiler.\nYou don't have evil features that obscures you code.\nYou also don't have hidden control flow happening behind the scenes. And, you also\ndon't have functions or operators from the standard library that make\nhidden memory allocations behind your back.\n\nBy being a simpler language, Zig becomes much more clear and easier to read/write,\nbut at the same time, it also achieves a much more robust state, with more consistent\nbehaviour in edge situations. Once again, less is more.\n\n\n## Hello world in Zig\n\nWe begin our journey in Zig by creating a small \"Hello World\" program.\nTo start a new Zig project in your computer, you simply call the `init` command\nfrom the `zig` compiler.\nJust create a new directory in your computer, then, init a new Zig project\ninside this directory, like this:\n\n```bash\nmkdir hello_world\ncd hello_world\nzig init\n```\n\n```\ninfo: created build.zig\ninfo: created build.zig.zon\ninfo: created src/main.zig\ninfo: created src/root.zig\ninfo: see `zig build --help` for a menu of options\n```\n\n### Understanding the project files {#sec-project-files}\n\nAfter you run the `init` command from the `zig` compiler, some new files\nare created inside of your current directory. First, a \"source\" (`src`) directory\nis created, containing two files, `main.zig` and `root.zig`. Each `.zig` file\nis a separate Zig module, which is simply a text file that contains some Zig code.\n\n\nThe `main.zig` file for example, contains a `main()` function, which represents\nthe entrypoint of your program. It is where the execution of your program begins.\nAs you would expect from a C, C++, Rust or Go,\nto build an executabe program in Zig, you also need to declare a `main()` function in your module.\nSo, the `main.zig` module represents an executable program written in Zig.\n\nOn the other side, the `root.zig` module does not contain a `main()` function. Because\nit represents a library written in Zig. Libraries are different than executables.\nThey don't need to have an entrypoint to work.\nSo, you can choose which file (`main.zig` or `root.zig`) you want to follow depending on which type\nof project (executable or library) you want to develop.\n\n```bash\ntree .\n```\n\n```\n.\n├── build.zig\n├── build.zig.zon\n└── src\n    ├── main.zig\n    └── root.zig\n\n1 directory, 4 files\n```\n\n\nNow, in addition to the source directory, two other files were created in our working directory:\n`build.zig` and `build.zig.zon`. The first file (`build.zig`) represents a build script written in Zig.\nThis script is executed when you call the `build` command from the `zig` compiler.\nIn other words, this file contain Zig code that executes the necessary steps to build the entire project.\n\nIn general, low-level languages normally use a compiler to build your\nsource code into binary executables or binary libraries.\nNevertheless, this process of compiling your source code and building\nbinary executables or binary libraries from it, became a real challenge\nin the programming world, once the projects became bigger and bigger.\nAs a result, programmers created \"build systems\", which are a second set of tools designed to make this process\nof compiling and building complex projects, easier.\n\nExamples of build systems are CMake, GNU Make, GNU Autoconf and Ninja,\nwhich are used to build complex C and C++ projects.\nWith these systems, you can write scripts, which are called \"build scripts\".\nThey simply are scripts that describes the necessary steps to compile/build\nyour project.\n\nHowever, these are separate tools, that do not\nbelong to C/C++ compilers, like `gcc` or `clang`.\nAs a result, in C/C++ projects, you have not only to install and\nmanage your C/C++ compilers, but you also have to install and manage\nthese build systems separately.\n\nBut instead of using a separate build system, in Zig, we use the\nZig language itself to write build scripts.\nIn other words, Zig contains a native build system in it. And\nwe can use this build system to write small scripts in Zig,\nwhich describes the necessary steps to build/compile our Zig project[^zig-build-system].\nSo, everything you need to build a complex Zig project is the\n`zig` compiler, and nothing more.\n\n[^zig-build-system]: <https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/#zig-build-system>.\n\n\nNow that we described this topic in more depth, let's focus\non the second generated file (`build.zig.zon`), which is the Zig package manager configuration file,\nwhere you can list and manage the dependencies of your project. Yes, Zig have\na package manager (like `pip` in Python, `cargo` in Rust, or `npm` in Javascript) called Zon,\nand this `build.zig.zon` file is similar to the `package.json` file\nin Javascript projects, or, the `Pipfile` in Python projects.\n\n\n### Looking at the `root.zig` file {#sec-root-file}\n\nLet's take a look at the `root.zig` file, and start to analyze some of the\nsyntax of Zig.\nThe first thing that you might notice, is that every line of code\nthat have an expression in it, ends with a semicolon character (`;`). This is\nsimilar syntax to other languages such as C, C++ and Rust,\nwhich have the same rule.\n\nAlso, notice the `@import()` call at the first line. We use this built-in function\nto import functionality from other Zig modules into our current module.\nIn other words, the `@import()` function works similarly to the `#include` pre-processor\nin C or C++, or, to the `import` statement in Python or Javascript code.\nIn this example, we are importing the `std` module,\nwhich gives you access to the Zig standard library.\n\nIn this `root.zig` file, we can also see how assignments (i.e. creating new objects)\nare made in Zig. You can create a new object in Zig by using the following syntax\n`(const|var) name = value;`. In the example below, we are creating two constant\nobjects (`std` and `testing`). At @sec-assignments we talk more about objects in general.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst testing = std.testing;\n\nexport fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFunctions in Zig are declared similarly to functions in Rust, using the `fn` keyword. In the example above,\nwe are declaring a function called `add()`, which have two arguments named `a` and `b`, and returns\na integer number (`i32`) as result.\n\nMaybe Zig is not exactly a strongly-typed language, because you do not need\nnecessarily to specify the type of every single object you create across your source code.\nBut you do have to explicitly specify the type of every function argument, and also,\nthe return type of every function you create in Zig. So, at least in function declarations,\nZig is a strongly-typed language.\n\nWe specify the type of an object or a function argument in Zig, by\nusing a colon character (`:`) followed by the type after the name of this object/function argument.\nWith the expressions `a: i32` and `b: i32`, we know that, both `a` and `b` arguments have type `i32`,\nwhich is a signed 32 bit integer. In this part,\nthe syntax in Zig is identical to the syntax in Rust, which also specifies types by\nusing the colon character.\n\nLastly, we have the return type of the function at the end of the line, before we open\nthe curly braces to start writing the function's body, which, in the example above is\nagain a signed 32 bit integer (`i32`) value. This specific part is different than it is in Rust.\nBecause in Rust, the return type of a function is specified after an arrow (`->`).\nWhile in Zig, we simply declare the return type directly after the parentheses with the function arguments.\n\nWe also have an `export` keyword before the function declaration. This keyword\nis similar to the `extern` keyword in C. It exposes the function\nto make it available in the library API.\n\nIn other words, if you have a project where you are currently building\na library for other people to use, you need to expose your functions\nso that they are available in the library's API, so that users can use it.\nIf we removed the `export` keyword from the `add()` function declaration,\nthen, this function would be no longer exposed in the library object built\nby the `zig` compiler.\n\n\nHaving that in mind, the keyword `export` is a keyword used in libraries written in Zig.\nSo, if you are not currently writing a library in your project, then, you do not need to\ncare about this keyword.\n\n\n### Looking at the `main.zig` file {#sec-main-file}\n\nNow that we have learned a lot about Zig's syntax from the `root.zig` file,\nlet's take a look at the `main.zig` file.\nA lot of the elements we saw in `root.zig` are also present in `main.zig`.\nBut we have some other elements that we did not have seen yet, so let's dive in.\n\nFirst, look at the return type of the `main()` function in this file.\nWe can see a small change. Now, the return\ntype of the function (`void`) is accompanied by an exclamation mark (`!`).\nWhat this exclamation mark is telling us, is that this `main()` function\nmight also return an error.\n\nSo, in this example, the `main()` function can either return `void`, or, return an error.\nThis is an interesting feature of Zig. If you write a function, and, something inside of\nthe body of this function might return an error, then, you are forced to:\n\n- either add the exclamation mark to the return type of the function, to make it clear that\nthis function might return an error.\n- or explicitly handle this error that might occur inside the function, to make sure that,\nif this error does happen, you are prepared, and your function will no longer return an error\nbecause you handled the error inside your function.\n\nIn most programming languages, we normally handle (or deals with) an error through\na *try catch* pattern, and Zig, this is no different. But, if we look at the `main()` function\nbelow, you can see that we do have a `try` keyword in the 5th line. But we do not have a `catch` keyword\nin this code.\n\nThis means that, we are using the keyword `try` to execute a code that might return an error,\nwhich is the `stdout.print()` expression. But because we do not have a `catch` keyword in this line,\nwe are not treating (or dealing with) this error.\nSo, if this expression do return an error, we are not catching and solving this error in any way.\nThat is why the exclamation mark was added to the return type of the function.\n\nSo, in essence, the `try` keyword executes the expression `stdout.print()`. If this expression\nreturns a valid value, then, the `try` keyword do nothing essentially. It simply passes this value forward. But, if the expression do\nreturn an error, then, the `try` keyword will unwrap and return this error from the function, and also print it's\nstack trace to `stderr`.\n\nThis might sound weird to you, if you come from a high-level language. Because in\nhigh-level languages, such as Python, if an error occurs somewhere, this error is automatically\nreturned and the execution of your program will automatically stops, even if you don't want\nto stop the execution. You are obligated to face the error.\n\nBut if you come from a low-level language, then, maybe, this idea do not sound so weird or distant to you.\nBecause in C for example, normally functions doesn't raise errors, or, they normally don't stop the execution.\nIn C, error handling\nis done by constantly checking the return value of the function. So, you run the function,\nand then, you use an if statement to check if the function returned a value that is valid,\nor, if it returned an error. If an error was returned from the function, then, the if statement\nwill execute some code that fixes this error.\n\nSo, at least for C programmers, they do need to write a lot of if statements to\nconstantly check for errors around their code. And because of that, this simple feature from Zig, might be\nextraordinary for them. Because this `try` keyword can automatically unwrap the error,\nand warn you about this error, and let you deal with it, without any extra work from the programmer.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"Hello, {s}!\\n\", .{\"world\"});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, another thing that you might have noticed in this code example, is that\nthe `main()` function is marked with the `pub` keyword. This keyword means\n\"public\". It marks the `main()` function as a *public function* from this module.\n\nIn other words, every function that you declare in your Zig module is, by default, a private (or \"static\")\nfunction that belongs to this Zig module, and can only be used (or called) from within this same module.\nUnless, you explicitly mark this function as a public function with the `pub` keyword.\nThis means that the `pub` keyword in Zig do essentially the opposite of what the `static` keyword\ndo in C/C++.\n\nBy making a function \"public\", you allow other Zig modules to access and call this function,\nand use it for they own purposes.\nall these other Zig modules need to do is, to import your module with the `@import()`\nbuilt-in function. Then, they get access to all public functions that are present in\nyour Zig module.\n\n\n### Compiling your source code {#sec-compile-code}\n\nYou can compile your Zig modules into a binary executable by running the `build-exe` command\nfrom the `zig` compiler. You simply list all the Zig modules that you want to build after\nthe `build-exe` command, separated by spaces. In the example below, we are compiling the module `main.zig`.\n\n```bash\nzig build-exe src/main.zig\n```\n\nSince we are building an executable, the `zig` compiler will look for a `main()` function\ndeclared in any of the files that you list after the `build-exe` command. If\nthe compiler does not find a `main()` function declared somewhere, a\ncompilation error will be raised, warning about this mistake.\n\nThe `zig` compiler also offers a `build-lib` and `build-obj` commands, which work\nthe exact same way as the `build-exe` command. The only difference is that, they compile your\nZig modules into a portale C ABI library, or, into object files, respectively.\n\nIn the case of the `build-exe` command, a binary executable file is created by the `zig`\ncompiler in the root directory of your project.\nIf we take a look now at the contents of our current directory, with a simple `ls` command, we can\nsee the binary file called `main` that was created by the compiler.\n\n```bash\nls\n```\n\n```\nbuild.zig  build.zig.zon  main  src\n```\n\nIf I execute this binary executable, I get the \"Hello World\" message in the terminal\n, as we expected.\n\n```bash\n./main\n```\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n### Compile and execute at the same time {#sec-compile-run-code}\n\nOn the previous section, I presented the `zig build-exe` command, which\ncompiles Zig modules into an executable file. However, this means that,\nin order to execute the executable file, we have to run two different commands.\nFirst, the `zig build-exe` command, and then, we call the executable file\ncreated by the compiler.\n\nBut what if we wanted to perform these two steps,\nall at once, in a single command? We can do that by using the `zig run`\ncommand.\n\n```bash\nzig run src/main.zig\n```\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n### Compiling the entire project {#sec-compile-project}\n\nJust as I described at @sec-project-files, as our project grows in size and\ncomplexity, we usually prefer to organize the compilation and build process\nof the project into a build script, using some sort of \"build system\".\n\nIn other words, as our project grows in size and complexity,\nthe `build-exe`, `build-lib` and `build-obj` commands become\nharder to use directly. Because then, we start to list\nmultiple and multiple modules at the same time. We also\nstart to add built-in compilation flags to customize the\nbuild process for our needs, etc. It becomes a lot of work\nto write the necessary commands by hand.\n\nIn C/C++ projects, programmers normally opt to use CMake, Ninja, `Makefile` or `configure` scripts\nto organize this process. However, in Zig, we have a native build system in the language itself.\nSo, we can write build scripts in Zig to compile and build Zig projects. Then, all we\nneed to do, is to call the `zig build` command to build our project.\n\nSo, when you execute the `zig build` command, the `zig` compiler will search\nfor a Zig module named `build.zig` inside your current directory, which\nshould be your build script, containing the necessary code to compile and\nbuild your project. If the compiler do find this `build.zig` file in your directory,\nthen, the compiler will essentially execute a `zig run` command\nover this `build.zig` file, to compile and execute this build\nscript, which in turn, will compile and build your entire project.\n\n\n```bash\nzig build\n```\n\n\nAfter you execute this \"build project\" command, a `zig-out` directory\nis created in the root of your project directory, where you can find\nthe binary executables and libraries created from your Zig modules\naccordingly to the build commands that you specified at `build.zig`.\nWe will talk more about the build system in Zig latter in this book.\n\nIn the example below, I'm executing the binary executable\nnamed `hello_world` that was generated by the compiler after the\n`zig build` command.\n\n```bash\n./zig-out/bin/hello_world\n```\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n<!--\n\n## High-level languages vs Low-level languages\n\nThis book will definitely help you, on your journey to learn Zig. But there is\na limit on how much a book can do. So you will need extra resources, and more\nstrategies if you want to trully be good at Zig.\n\nYou will need more resources, not because Zig is necessarily a hard language to learn, but\nbecause it is a low-level language. I'm emphasizing that, because not many people think much about\nthe consequences of this fact. As I sad earlier, Zig is a very simple language, with very\nsimple syntax. But because it is a low-level language, you will have\nto write (at least) as twice amount of Zig code to do a similar job that you would do on a high-level\nlanguage, such as Python or Javascript.\n\nIn other words, with a low-level language you get much more control and power, but\nyou also get a lot more responsibilities. You have to be much more explicit and\ninclude much more details in your code to make it work properly. This is an intrinsic\ncharacteristic present in all low-level languages, such as C, C++ and Rust.\n\nAnother side of the problem with low-level languages is that they require a different set of skills and knowledges from you,\nand this creates a skill (or knowledge) gap for a lot of professionals.\nI mean, high-level languages are so much easier, that you, as a professional, can work\nand focus on other things, or other aspects of your profession that might be equally important to your career,\nsuch as: doing a graduate course, or learning more about business strategy, product development, and\nsoft skills (such as communication skills, personal development).\n\nJust as a simple example, a part of the readers of this book probably work with Websites and APIs in the Web,\nusing either Javascript, Python or PHP. These high-level languages include multiple layers of abstractions in them,\nwhich will help you to work quicker and with ease. As a consequence, dealing with APIs in these languages is much simpler.\nBecause you don't have to learn all of these very specific terms and technical knowledge about\nhow HTTP actually works at the lowest level. All you really need to know, is which library to use,\nand how to assemble the parts that make a HTTP Request.\n\nIn contrast, when working with a low-level language, most of the times you have to implement\na HTTP Server from scratch, or, to use a library that helps you get there, but doesn't \ninclude a high amount of abstractions. As a result of that, you need to learn a lot of\ndetails about how HTTP actually works at the lowest level. You will probably need to learn: 1) some details about\nthe HTTP Protocol specification; 2) a lot of technical terms about web sockets (such as \"listen\", \"bind socket\", \"accept connection\");\n3) how to create TCP connections using IP addresses; 4) learn about the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.\nIn essence, when you work with a low-level language, you have to know much more details about everything you do.\n\nAnother topic that makes low-level languages much harder to learn than high-level languages is compilation.\nIn low-level languages, you have to use a compiler to compile your source code into binary executables or \nlibraries. But compiling the same source code in multiple platforms, for multiple targets, is actually\nincredibly hard, and a real challenge in our modern world.\nDifferences between the manufacturing and architecture of each computer, or, the differences between\nthe operational system used, make this really hard on low-level languages, specially in C and C++.\n\nThis compilation problem arises very quickly when we are developing big libraries (or applications)\nin C or C++ that are, at the same time, cross-platform and highly optimized.\nAs I described at @sec-project-files, this is the whole reason why we created a whole set of separate tools named \"build systems\".\nTo abstract some of these barriers that exists in the compilation process at low-level languages.\n\n-->\n\n\n\n## How to learn Zig?\n\nWhat are the best strategies to learn Zig? \nFirst of all, of course this book will help you a lot on your journey through Zig.\nBut you will also need some extra resources if you want to be really good at Zig.\n\nAs a first tip, you can join a community with Zig programmers to get some help\n, when you need it:\n\n- Reddit forum: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/>;\n- Ziggit community: <https://ziggit.dev/>;\n- Discord, Slack, Telegram, and others: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community>;\n\nNow, one of the best ways to learn Zig is to simply read Zig code. Try\nto read Zig code often, and things will become more clear.\nA C/C++ programmer would also probably give you this same tip.\nBecause this strategy really works!\n\nNow, where you can find Zig code to read?\nI personally think that, the best way of reading Zig code is to read the source code of the\nZig Standard Library. Also, a great alternative is to read code from large Zig\ncodebases, such as the [Javascript runtime Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)[^bunjs].\nBoth of these assets are available on GitHub,\nand this is great, because we can use the GitHub search bar in our advantage,\nto find Zig code that fits our description.\n\n[^bunjs]: <https://github.com/oven-sh/bun>.\n\nThe Zig Standard Library is available at the [`lib/std` folder](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std)[^zig-lib-std] on\nthe official GitHub repository of Zig. Access this folder, and start exploring the Zig modules. If you want to search for\noccurrences of a specific Zig function in this folder, remember to include `lang:Zig` in the GitHub search bar. This will limit\nthe search to only Zig modules.\n\n[^zig-lib-std]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std>\n\nAlso, a great alternative is to consult online resources and documentations.\nHere is a quick list of resources that I personally use from time to time to learn\nmore about the language each day:\n\n- Zig Language Reference: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/>;\n- Zig Standard Library Reference: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/>;\n- Zig Guide: <https://zig.guide/>;\n- Karl Seguin Blog: <https://www.openmymind.net/>;\n- Zig News: <https://zig.news/>;\n- Read the code written by one of the Zig core team members: <https://github.com/kubkon>;\n- Some livecoding sessions are transmitted in the Zig Showtime Youtube Channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@ZigSHOWTIME/videos>;\n\n\nAnother great strategy to learn Zig, or honestly, to learn any language you want,\nis to practice it by solving exercises. For example, there is a famous repository\nin the Zig community called [Ziglings](https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/)[^ziglings]\n, which contains more than 100 small exercises that you can solve. It is a repository of\ntiny programs written in Zig that are currently broken, and your responsibility is to\nfix these programs, and make them work again.\n\n[^ziglings]: <https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/>.\n\nA famous tech YouTuber known as *The Primeagen* also posted some videos (at YouTube)\nwhere he solves these exercises from Ziglings. The first video is named\n[\"Trying Zig Part 1\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuztQfM3Fg&t=2524s&ab_channel=TheVimeagen)[^prime1].\n\n[^prime1]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuztQfM3Fg&t=2524s&ab_channel=TheVimeagen>.\n\nAnother great alternative, is to solve the [Advent of Code exercises](https://adventofcode.com/)[^advent-code].\nThere are people that already took the time to learn and solve the exercises, and they posted\ntheir solutions on GitHub as well, so, in case you need some resource to compare while solving\nthe exercises, you can look at these two repositories:\n\n- <https://github.com/SpexGuy/Zig-AoC-Template>;\n- <https://github.com/fjebaker/advent-of-code-2022>;\n\n[^advent-code]: <https://adventofcode.com/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Creating new objects in Zig (i.e. identifiers) {#sec-assignments}\n\nLet's talk more about objects in Zig. Readers that have past experience\nwith other programming languages might know this concept through\na different name, such as: \"variable\" or \"identifier\". In this book, I choose\nto use the term \"object\" to refer to this concept.\n\nTo create a new object (or a new \"identifier\") in Zig, we use\nthe keywords `const` or `var`. These keywords specificy if the object\nthat you are creating is mutable or not.\nIf you use `const`, then the object you are\ncreating is a constant (or immutable) object, which means that once you declare this object, you\ncan no longer change the value stored inside this object.\n\nOn the other side, if you use `var`, then, you are creating a variable (or mutable) object.\nYou can change the value of this object as many times you want. Using the\nkeyword `var` in Zig is similar to using the keywords `let mut` in Rust.\n\n### Constant objects vs variable objects\n\nIn the code example below, we are creating a new constant object called `age`.\nThis object stores a number representing the age of someone. However, this code example\ndoes not compiles succesfully. Because on the next line of code, we are trying to change the value\nof the object `age` to 25.\n\nThe `zig` compiler detects that we are trying to change\nthe value of an object/identifier that is constant, and because of that,\nthe compiler will raise a compilation error, warning us about the mistake.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst age = 24;\n// The line below is not valid!\nage = 25;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nt.zig:10:5: error: cannot assign to constant\n    age = 25;\n      ~~^~~\n```\n\nIn contrast, if you use `var`, then, the object created is a variable object.\nWith `var` you can declare this object in your source code, and then,\nchange the value of this object how many times you want over future points\nin your source code.\n\nSo, using the same code example exposed above, if I change the declaration of the\n`age` object to use the `var` keyword, then, the program gets compiled succesfully.\nBecause now, the `zig` compiler detects that we are changing the value of an\nobject that allows this behaviour, because it is an \"variable object\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar age: u8 = 24;\nage = 25;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Declaring without an initial value\n\nBy default, when you declare a new object in Zig, you must give it\nan initial value. In other words, this means\nthat we have to declare, and, at the same time, initialize every object we\ncreate in our source code.\n\nOn the other hand, you can, in fact, declare a new object in your source code,\nand not give it an explicit value. But we need to use a special keyword for that,\nwhich is the `undefined` keyword.\n\nIs important to emphasize that, you should avoid using `undefined` as much as possible.\nBecause when you use this keyword, you leave your object uninitialized, and, as a consequence,\nif for some reason, your code use this object while it is uninitialized, then, you will definitely\nhave undefined behaviour and major bugs in your program.\n\nIn the example below, I'm declaring the `age` object again. But this time,\nI do not give it an initial value. The variable is only initialized at\nthe second line of code, where I store the number 25 in this object.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar age: u8 = undefined;\nage = 25;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHaving these points in mind, just remember that you should avoid as much as possible to use `undefined` in your code.\nAlways declare and initialize your objects. Because this gives you much more safety in your program.\nBut in case you really need to declare an object without initializing it... the\n`undefined` keyword is the way to do it in Zig.\n\n\n### There is no such thing as unused objects\n\nEvery object (being constant or variable) that you declare in Zig **must be used in some way**. You can give this object\nto a function call, as a function argument, or, you can use it in another expression\nto calculate the value of another object, or, you can call a method that belongs to this\nparticular object. \n\nIt doesn't matter in which way you use it. As long as you use it.\nIf you try to break this rule, i.e. if your try to declare a object, but not use it,\nthe `zig` compiler will not compile your Zig source code, and it will issue a error\nmessage warning that you have unused objects in your code.\n\nLet's demonstrate this with an example. In the source code below, we declare a constant object\ncalled `age`. If you try to compile a simple Zig program with this line of code below,\nthe compiler will return an error as demonstrated below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst age = 15;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nt.zig:4:11: error: unused local constant\n    const age = 15;\n          ^~~\n```\n\nEverytime you declare a new object in Zig, you have two choices:\n\n1. you either use the value of this object;\n2. or you explicitly discard the value of the object;\n\nTo explicitly discard the value of any object (constant or variable), all you need to do is to assign\nthis object to an special character in Zig, which is the underscore (`_`).\nWhen you assign an object to a underscore, like in the example below, the `zig` compiler will automatically\ndiscard the value of this particular object.\n\nYou can see in the example below that, this time, the compiler did not\ncomplain about any \"unused constant\", and succesfully compiled our source code.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// It compiles!\nconst age = 15;\n_ = age;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, remember, everytime you assign a particular object to the underscore, this object\nis essentially destroyed. It is discarded by the compiler. This means that you can no longer\nuse this object further in your code. It doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSo if you try to use the constant `age` in the example below, after we discarded it, you\nwill get a loud error message from the compiler (talking about a \"pointless discard\")\nwarning you about this mistake.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// It does not compile.\nconst age = 15;\n_ = age;\n// Using a discarded value!\nstd.debug.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{age + 2});\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nt.zig:7:5: error: pointless discard\n    of local constant\n```\n\n\nThis same rule applies to variable objects. Every variable object must also be used in\nsome way. And if you assign a variable object to the underscore,\nthis object also get's discarded, and you can no longer use this object.\n\n\n\n### You must mutate every variable objects\n\nEvery variable object that you create in your source code must be mutated at some point.\nIn other words, if you declare an object as a variable\nobject, with the keyword `var`, and you do not change the value of this object\nat some point in the future, the `zig` compiler will detect this,\nand it will raise an error warning you about this mistake.\n\nThe concept behind this is that every object you create in Zig should be preferably a\nconstant object, unless you really need an object whose value will\nchange during the execution of your program.\n\nSo, if I try to declare a variable object such as `where_i_live` below,\nand I do not change the value of this object in some way,\nthe `zig` compiler raises an error message with the phrase \"variable is never mutated\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar where_i_live = \"Belo Horizonte\";\n_ = where_i_live;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nt.zig:7:5: error: local variable is never mutated\nt.zig:7:5: note: consider using 'const'\n```\n\n## Primitive Data Types\n\nZig have many different primitive data types available for you to use.\nYou can see the full list of available data types at the official\n[Language Reference page](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Primitive-Types)[^lang-data-types].\n\n[^lang-data-types]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Primitive-Types>.\n\nBut here is a quick list:\n\n- Unsigned integers: `u8`, 8-bit integer; `u16`, 16-bit integer; `u32`, 32-bit integer; `u64`, 64-bit integer; `u128`, 128-bit integer.\n- Signed integers: `i8`, 8-bit integer; `i16`, 16-bit integer; `i32`, 32-bit integer; `i64`, 64-bit integer; `i128`, 128-bit integer.\n- Float number: `f16`, 16-bit floating point; `f32`, 32-bit floating point; `f64`, 64-bit floating point; `f128`, 128-bit floating point;\n- Boolean: `bool`, represents true or false values.\n- C ABI compatible types: `c_long`, `c_char`, `c_short`, `c_ushort`, `c_int`, `c_uint`, and many others.\n- Pointer sized integers: `isize` and `usize`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Arrays {#sec-arrays}\n\nYou create arrays in Zig by using a syntax that resembles the C syntax.\nFirst, you specify the size of the array (i.e. the number of elements that will be stored in the array)\nyou want to create inside a pair of brackets.\n\nThen, you specify the data type of the elements that will be stored inside this array.\nAll elements present in an array in Zig must have the same data type. For example, you cannot mix elements\nof type `f32` with elements of type `i32` in the same array.\n\nAfter that, you simply list the values that you want to store in this array inside\na pair of curly braces.\nIn the example below, I am creating two constant objets that contain different arrays.\nThe first object contains an array of 4 integer values, while the second object,\nan array of 3 floating point values.\n\nNow, you should notice that in the object `ls`, I am\nnot explicitly specifying the size of the array inside of the brackets. Instead\nof using a literal value (like the value 4 that I used in the `ns` object), I am\nusing the special character underscore (`_`). This syntax tells the `zig` compiler\nto fill this field with the number of elements listed inside of the curly braces.\nSo, this syntax `[_]` is for lazy (or smart) programmers who leave the job of\ncounting how many elements there are in the curly braces for the compiler.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst ls = [_]f64{432.1, 87.2, 900.05};\n_ = ns; _ = ls;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Selecting elements of the array\n\nOne very commom activity is to select specific portions of an array\nyou have in your source code.\nIn Zig, you can select a specific element from your\narray, by simply providing the index of this particular\nelement inside brackets after the object name.\nIn the example below, I am selecting the third element from the\n`ns` array. Notice that Zig is a \"zero-index\" based language,\nlike C, C++, Rust, Python, and many other languages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\ntry stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{ ns[2] });\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn contrast, you can also select specific slices (or sections) of your array, by using a\nrange selector. Some programmers also call these selectors of \"slice selectors\",\nand they also exist in Rust, and have the exact same syntax as in Zig.\nAnyway, a range selector is a special expression in Zig that defines\na range of indexes, and it have the syntax `start..end`.\n\nIn the example below, at the second line of code,\nthe `sl` object stores a slice (or a portion) of the\n`ns` array. More precisely, the elements at index 1 and 2\nin the `ns` array. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ns[1..3];\n_ = sl;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen you use the `start..end` syntax,\nthe \"end tail\" of the range selector is non-inclusive,\nmeaning that, the index at the end is not included in the range that is\nselected from the array.\nTherefore, the syntax `start..end` actually means `start..end - 1` in practice.\n\nYou can for example, create a slice that goes from the first to the\nlast elements of the array, by using `ar[0..ar.len]` syntax\nIn other words, it is a slice that\naccess all elements in the array.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ar = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ar[0..ar.len];\n_ = sl;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can also use the syntax `start..` in your range selector.\nWhich tells the `zig` compiler to select the portion of the array\nthat begins at the `start` index until the last element of the array.\nIn the example below, we are selecting the range from index 1\nuntil the end of the array.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ns[1..];\n_ = sl;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### More on slices\n\nAs we discussed before, in Zig, you can select specific portions of an existing\narray. This is called *slicing* in Zig [@zigguide], because when you select a portion\nof an array, you are creating a slice object from that array.\n\nA slice object is essentially a pointer object accompained by a length number.\nThe pointer object points to the first element in the slice, and the\nlength number tells the `zig` compiler how many elements there are in this slice.\n\n> Slices can be thought of as a pair of `[*]T` (the pointer to the data) and a `usize` (the element count) [@zigguide].\n\nThrough the pointer contained inside the slice you can access the elements (or values)\nthat are inside this range (or portion) that you selected from the original array.\nBut the length number (which you can access through the `len` property of your slice object)\nis the really big improvement (over C arrays for example) that Zig brings to the table here.\n\nBecause with this length number\nthe `zig` compiler can easily check if you are trying to access an index that is out of the bounds of this particular slice,\nor, if you are causing any buffer overflow problems. In the example below,\nwe access the `len` property of the slice `sl`, which tells us that this slice\nhave 2 elements in it.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ns[1..3];\ntry stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{sl.len});\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Array operators\n\nThere are two array operators available in Zig that are very useful.\nThe array concatenation operator (`++`), and the array multiplication operator (`**`). As the name suggests,\nthese are array operators.\n\nOne important detail about these two operators is that they work\nonly when both operands have a size (or \"length\") that is compile-time known.\nWe are going to talk more about\nthe differences between \"compile-time known\" and \"runtime known\" at @sec-compile-time.\nBut for now, keep this information in mind, that you cannot use these operators in every situation.\n\nIn summary, the `++` operator creates a new array that is the concatenation,\nof both arrays provided as operands. So, the expression `a ++ b` produces\na new array which contains all the elements from arrays `a` and `b`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst a = [_]u8{1,2,3};\nconst b = [_]u8{4,5};\nconst c = a ++ b;\ntry stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{c});\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis `++` operator is particularly useful to concatenate strings together.\nStrings in Zig are described in depth at @sec-zig-strings. In summary, a string object in Zig\nis essentially an arrays of bytes. So, you can use this array concatenation operator\nto effectively concatenate strings together.\n\nIn contrast, the `**` operator is used to replicate an array multiple\ntimes. In other words, the expression `a ** 3` creates a new array\nwhich contains the elements of the array `a` repeated 3 times.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst a = [_]u8{1,2,3};\nconst c = a ** 2;\ntry stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{c});\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Control flow {#sec-zig-control-flow}\n\nSometimes, you need to make decisions in your program. Maybe you need to decide\nwether to execute or not a specific piece of code. Or maybe,\nyou need to apply the same operation over a sequence of values. These kinds of tasks,\ninvolve using structures that are capable of changing the \"control flow\" of our program.\n\nIn computer science, the term \"control flow\" usually refers to the order in which expressions (or commands)\nare evaluated in a given language or program. But this term is also used to refer\nto structures that are capable of changing this \"evaluation order\" of the commands\nexecuted by a given language/program.\n\nThese structures are better known\nby a set of terms, such as: loops, if/else statements, switch statements, among others. So,\nloops and if/else statements are examples of structures that can change the \"control\nflow\" of our program. The keywords `continue` and `break` are also examples of symbols\nthat can change the order of evaluation, since they can move our program to the next iteration\nof a loop, or make the loop stop completely.\n\n\n### If/else statements\n\nAn if/else statement performs an \"conditional flow operation\".\nA conditional flow control (or choice control) allows you to execute\nor ignore a certain block of commands based on a logical condition.\nMany programmers and computer science professionals also use\nthe term \"branching\" in this case.\nIn essence, we use if/else statements to use the result of a logical test\nto decide whether or not to execute a given block of commands.\n\nIn Zig, we write if/else statements by using the keywords `if` and `else`.\nWe start with the `if` keyword followed by a logical test inside a pair\nof parentheses, and then, a pair of curly braces with contains the lines\nof code to be executed in case the logical test returns the value `true`.\n\nAfter that, you can optionally add an `else` statement. Just add the `else`\nkeyword followed by a pair of curly braces, with the lines of code\nto executed in case the logical test defined in the `if`\nreturns `false`.\n\nIn the example below, we are testing if the object `x` contains a number\nthat is greater than 10. Judging by the output printed to the console,\nwe know that this logical test returned `false`. Because the output\nin the console is compatible with the line of code present in the\n`else` branch of the if/else statement.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst x = 5;\nif (x > 10) {\n    try stdout.print(\n        \"x > 10!\\n\", .{}\n    );\n} else {\n    try stdout.print(\n        \"x <= 10!\\n\", .{}\n    );\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nx <= 10!\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### For loops\n\nA loop allows you to execute the same lines of code multiple times,\nthus, creating a \"repetition space\" in the execution flow of your program.\nLoops are particularly useful when we want to replicate the same function\n(or the same set of commands) over several different inputs.\n\nThere are different types of loops available in Zig. But the most\nessential of them all is probably the *for loop*. A for loop is\nused to apply the same piece of code over the elements of a slice or an array.\n\nFor loops in Zig have a slightly different syntax that you are\nprobably used to see in other languages. You start with the `for` keyword, then, you\nlist the items that you want to iterate\nover inside a pair of parentheses. Then, inside of a pair of pipes (`|`)\nyou should declare an identifier that will serve as your iterator, or,\nthe \"repetition index of the loop\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nfor (items) |value| {\n    // code to execute\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nInstead of using a `(value in items)` syntax,\nin Zig, for loops use the syntax `(items) |value|`. In the example\nbelow, you can see that we are looping through the items\nof the array stored at the object `name`, and printing to the\nconsole the decimal representation of each character in this array.\n\nIf we wanted, we could also iterate through a slice (or a portion) of\nthe array, instead of iterating through the entire array stored in the `name` object.\nJust use a range selector to select the section you want. For example,\nI could provide the expression `name[0..3]` to the for loop, to iterate\njust through the first 3 elements in the array.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst name = [_]u8{'P','e','d','r','o'};\nfor (name) |char| {\n    try stdout.print(\"{d} | \", .{char});\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n80 | 101 | 100 | 114 | 111 | \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn the above example we are using the value itself of each\nelement in the array as our iterator. But there are many situations where\nwe need to use an index instead of the actual values of the items.\n\nYou can do that by providing a second set of items to iterate over.\nMore precisely, you provide the range selector `0..` to the for loop. So,\nyes, you can use two different iterators at the same time in a for\nloop in Zig.\n\nBut remember from @sec-assignments that, every object\nyou create in Zig must be used in some way. So if you declare two iterators\nin your for loop, you must use both iterators inside the for loop body.\nBut if you want to use just the index iterator, and not use the \"value iterator\",\nthen, you can discard the value iterator by maching the\nvalue items to the underscore character, like in the example below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nfor (name, 0..) |_, i| {\n    try stdout.print(\"{d} | \", .{i});\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\n0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n```\n\n\n### While loops\n\nA while loop is created from the `while` keyword. While a `for` loop\niterates through the items of an array, a `while` loop\nwill loop continuously, and infinitely, until a logical test\n(specified by you) becomes false.\n\nYou start with the `while` keyword, then, you define a logical\nexpression inside a pair of parentheses, and the body of the\nloop is provided inside a pair of curly braces, like in the example below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar i: u8 = 1;\nwhile (i < 5) {\n    try stdout.print(\"{d} | \", .{i});\n    i += 1;\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Using `break` and `continue`\n\nIn Zig, you can explicitly stop the execution of a loop, or, jump to the next iteration of the loop, using\nthe keywords `break` and `continue`, respectively. The `while` loop present in the example below, is\nat first sight, an infinite loop. Because the logical value inside the parenthese will always be equal to `true`.\nWhat makes this `while` loop stop when the `i` object reaches the count\n10? Is the `break` keyword!\n\nInside the while loop, we have an if statement that is constantly checking if the `i` variable\nis equal to 10. Since we are increasing the value of this `i` variable at each iteration of the\nwhile loop. At some point, this `i` variable will be equal to 10, and when it does, the if statement\nwill execute the `break` expression, and, as a result, the execution of the while loop is stopped.\n\nNotice the `expect()` function from the Zig standard library after the while loop.\nThis `expect()` function is an \"assert\" type of function.\nThis function checks if the logical test provided is equal to true. If this logical test is false,\nthe function raises an assertion error. But it is equal to true, then, the function will do nothing.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar i: usize = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n    if (i == 10) {\n        break;\n    }\n    i += 1;\n}\ntry std.testing.expect(i == 10);\ntry stdout.print(\"Everything worked!\", .{});\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nEverything worked!\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSince this code example was executed succesfully by the `zig` compiler,\nwithout raising any errors, then, we known that, after the execution of while loop,\nthe `i` variable is equal to 10. Because if it wasn't equal to 10, then, an error would\nbe raised by `expect()`.\n\nNow, in the next example, we have an use case for\nthe `continue` keyword. The if statement is constantly\nchecking if the current index is a multiple of 2. If\nit is, then we jump to the next iteration of the loop\ndirectly. But it the current index is not a multiple of 2,\nthen, the loop will simply print this index to the console.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [_]u8{1,2,3,4,5,6};\nfor (ns) |i| {\n    if ((i % 2) == 0) {\n        continue;\n    }\n    try stdout.print(\"{d} | \", .{i});\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1 | 3 | 5 | \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Structs and OOP {#sec-structs-and-oop}\n\nZig is a language more closely related to C (which is a procedural language),\nthan it is to C++ or Java (which are object-oriented languages). Because of that, you do not\nhave advanced OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) patterns available in Zig, such as classes, interfaces or\nclass inheritance. Nonetheless, OOP in Zig is still possible by using struct definitions.\n\nWith struct definitions, you can create (or define) a new data type in Zig. These struct definitions work the same way as they work in C.\nYou give a name to this new struct (or, to this new data type you are creating), then, you list the data members of this new struct. You can\nalso register functions inside this struct, and they become the methods of this particular struct (or data type), so that, every object\nthat you create with this new type, will always have these methods available and associated with them.\n\nIn C++, when we create a new class, we normally have a constructor method (or, a constructor function) to construct or to instantiate every object\nof this particular class, and you also have a destructor method (or a destructor function) that\nis the function responsible for destroying every object of this class.\n\nIn Zig, we normally declare the constructor and the destructor methods\nof our structs, by declaring an `init()` and a `deinit()` methods inside the struct.\nThis is just a naming convention that you will find across the entire Zig standard library.\nSo, in Zig, the `init()` method of a struct is normally the constructor method of the class represented by this struct.\nWhile the `deinit()` method is the method used for destroying an existing instance of that struct.\n\nBoth the `init()` and `deinit()` methods are used extensively in Zig code, and you will see both of them at @sec-arena-allocator. In this section,\nI present the `ArenaAllocator()`, which is a special type of allocator object that receives a second (child)\nallocator object at instantiation. We use the `init()` method to create a new `ArenaAllocator()` object,\nthen, on the next line, we also used the `deinit()` method in conjunction with the `defer` keyword, to destroy this arena allocator object at the end\nof the current scope.\n\nBut, as another example, let's build a simple `User` struct to represent an user of some sort of system.\nIf you look at the `User` struct below, you can see the `struct` keyword, and inside of a\npair of curly braces, we write the struct's body.\n\nNotice the data members of this struct, `id`, `name` and `email`. Every data member have it's\ntype explicitly annotated, with the colon character (`:`) syntax that we described earlier at @sec-root-file.\nBut also notice that every line in the struct body that describes a data member, ends with a comma character (`,`).\nSo every time you declare a data member in your Zig code, always end the line with a comma character, instead\nof ending it with the traditional semicolon character (`;`).\n\nNext, also notice in this example, that we registrated an `init()` function as a method\nof this `User` struct. This `init()` method is the constructor method that you use to instantiate\nevery new `User` object. That is why this `init()` function return an `User` object as result.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\nconst User = struct {\n    id: u64,\n    name: []const u8,\n    email: []const u8,\n\n    pub fn init(id: u64,\n                name: []const u8,\n                email: []const u8) User {\n\n        return User {\n            .id = id,\n            .name = name,\n            .email = email\n        };\n    }\n\n    pub fn print_name(self: User) !void {\n        try stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{self.name});\n    }\n};\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const u = User.init(1, \"pedro\", \"email@gmail.com\");\n    try u.print_name();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\npedro\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe `pub` keyword plays an important role in struct declarations, and OOP in Zig.\nEvery method that you declare in your struct that is marked with the keyword `pub`,\nbecomes a public method of this particular struct.\n\nSo every method that you create in your struct, is, at first, a private method\nof that struct. Meaning that, this method can only be called from within this\nstruct. But, if you mark this method as public, with the keyword `pub`, then,\nyou can call the method directly from the `User` object you have\nin your code.\n\nIn other words, the functions marked by the keyword `pub`\nare members of the public API of that struct.\nFor example, if I did not marked the `print_name()` method as public,\nthen, I could not execute the line `u.print_name()`. Because I would\nnot be authorized to call this method directly in my code.\n\n\n\n\n## Anonymous struct literals\n\nYou can declare a struct object as a literal value. When we do that, we normally specify the\ndata type of this struct literal by writing it's data type just before the opening curly braces.\nFor example, I could write a struct literal of type `User` that we defined in the previous section like\nthis:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst eu = User {\n    .id = 1,\n    .name = \"Pedro\",\n    .email = \"someemail@gmail.com\"\n};\n_ = eu;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHowever, in Zig, we can also write an anonymous struct literal. That is, you can write a\nstruct literal, but not especify explicitly the type of this particular struct.\nAn anonymous struct is written by using the syntax `.{}`. So, we essentially\nreplaced the explicit type of the struct literal with a dot character (`.`).\n\nWhen you do that, the type of this struct literal is automatically inferred by the `zig` compiler.\nIn essence, the `zig` compiler will look for some hint of what is the type of that struct.\nIt can be the type annotation of an function argument,\nor the return type annotation of the function that you are using, or the type annotation\nof a variable.\nIf the compiler do find such type annotation, then, it will use this\ntype in your literal struct. \n\nAnonymous structs are very commom to use in function arguments in Zig.\nOne example that you have seen already constantly, is the `print()`\nfunction from the `stdout` object.\nThis function takes two arguments.\nThe first argument, is a template string, which should\ncontain string format specifiers in it, which tells how the values provided\nin the second argument should be printed into the message.\n\nWhile the second argument is a struct literal that lists the values\nto be printed into the template message specified in the first argument.\nYou normally want to use an anonymous struct literal here, so that, the\n`zig` compiler do the job of specifying the type of this particular\nanonymous struct for you.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\npub fn main() !void {\n    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n    try stdout.print(\"Hello, {s}!\\n\", .{\"world\"});\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## How strings work in Zig? {#sec-zig-strings}\n\nThe first project that we are going to build and discuss in this book is a base64 encoder/decoder (@sec-base64).\nBut in order for us to build such a thing, we need to get a better understanding on how strings work in Zig.\nSo let's discuss this specific aspect of Zig.\n\nIn Zig, a string literal (or a string object if you prefer) is a pointer to a null-terminated array\nof bytes. Each byte in this array is represented by an `u8` value, which is an unsigned 8 bit integer,\nso, it is equivalent to the C data type `unsigned char`.\n\nZig always assumes that this sequence of bytes is UTF-8 encoded. This might not be true for every\nsequence of bytes you have it, but is not really Zig's job to fix the encoding of your strings\n(you can use [`iconv`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/)[^libiconv] for that).\nToday, most of the text in our modern world, specially on the web, should be UTF-8 encoded.\nSo if your string literal is not UTF-8 encoded, then, you will likely\nhave problems in Zig.\n\n[^libiconv]: <https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>\n\nLet’s take for example the word \"Hello\". In UTF-8, this sequence of characters (H, e, l, l, o)\nis represented by the sequence of decimal numbers 72, 101, 108, 108, 111. In xecadecimal, this\nsequence is `0x48`, `0x65`, `0x6C`, `0x6C`, `0x6F`. So if I take this sequence of hexadecimal values,\nand ask Zig to print this sequence of bytes as a sequence of characters (i.e. a string), then,\nthe text \"Hello\" will be printed into the terminal:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const bytes = [_]u8{0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F};\n    try stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{bytes});\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nHello\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see the actual bytes that represents a string in Zig, you can use\na `for` loop to iterate trough each byte in the string, and ask Zig to print each byte as an hexadecimal\nvalue to the terminal. You do that by using a `print()` statement with the `X` formatting specifier,\nlike you would normally do with the [`printf()` function](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/)[^printfs] in C.\n\n[^printfs]: <https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_literal = \"This is an example of string literal in Zig\";\n    try stdout.print(\"Bytes that represents the string object: \", .{});\n    for (string_literal) |byte| {\n        try stdout.print(\"{X} \", .{byte});\n    }\n    try stdout.print(\"\\n\", .{});\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBytes that represents the string object: 54 68 69 \n   73 20 69 73 20 61 6E 20 65 78 61 6D 70 6C 65 20 6F\n  F 66 20 73 74 72 69 6E 67 20 6C 69 74 65 72 61 6C 2\n  20 69 6E 20 5A 69 67 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Strings in C\n\nAt first glance, this looks very similar to how C treats strings as well. That is, string values\nin C are also treated internally as an array of bytes, and this array is also null-terminated.\n\nBut one key difference between a Zig string and a C string, is that Zig also stores the length of\nthe array inside the string object. This small detail makes your code safer, because is much\neasier for the Zig compiler to check if you are trying to access an element that is \"out of bounds\", i.e. if\nyour trying to access memory that does not belong to you.\n\nTo achieve this same kind of safety in C, you have to do a lot of work that kind of seems pointless.\nSo getting this kind of safety is not automatic and much harder to do in C. For example, if you want\nto track the length of your string troughout your program in C, then, you first need to loop through\nthe array of bytes that represents this string, and find the null element (`'\\0'`) position to discover\nwhere exactly the array ends, or, in other words, to find how much elements the array of bytes contain.\n\nTo do that, you would need something like this in C. In this example, the C string stored in\nthe object `array` is 25 bytes long:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    char* array = \"An example of string in C\";\n    int index = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        if (array[index] == '\\0') {\n            break;\n        }\n        index++;\n    }\n    printf(\"Number of elements in the array: %d\\n\", index);\n}\n```\n\n```\nNumber of elements in the array: 25\n```\n\nBut in Zig, you do not have to do this, because the object already contains a `len`\nfield which stores the length information of the array. As an example, the `string_literal` object below is 43 bytes long:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_literal = \"This is an example of string literal in Zig\";\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{string_literal.len});\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n43\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### A better look at the object type\n\nNow, we can inspect better the type of objects that Zig create. To check the type of any object in Zig, you can use the\n`@TypeOf()` function. If we look at the type of the `simple_array` object below, you will find that this object\nis a array of 4 elements. Each element is a signed integer of 32 bits which corresponds to the data type `i32` in Zig.\nThat is what an object of type `[4]i32` is.\n\nBut if we look closely at the type of the `string_literal` object below, you will find that this object is a\nconstant pointer (hence the `*const` annotation) to an array of 43 elements (or 43 bytes). Each element is a\nsingle byte (more precisely, an unsigned 8 bit integer - `u8`), that is why we have the `[43:0]u8` portion of the type below.\nIn other words, the string stored inside the `string_literal` object is 43 bytes long.\nThat is why you have the type `*const [43:0]u8` below.\n\nIn the case of `string_literal`, it is a constant pointer (`*const`) because the object `string_literal` is declared\nas constant in the source code (in the line `const string_literal = ...`). So, if we changed that for some reason, if\nwe declare `string_literal` as a variable object (i.e. `var string_literal = ...`), then, `string_literal` would be\njust a normal pointer to an array of unsigned 8-bit integers (i.e. `* [43:0]u8`).\n\nNow, if we create an pointer to the `simple_array` object, then, we get a constant pointer to an array of 4 elements (`*const [4]i32`),\nwhich is very similar to the type of the `string_literal` object. This demonstrates that a string object (or a string literal)\nin Zig is already a pointer to an array.\n\nJust remember that a \"pointer to an array\" is different than an \"array\". So a string object in Zig is a pointer to an array\nof bytes, and not simply an array of bytes.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_literal = \"This is an example of string literal in Zig\";\n    const simple_array = [_]i32{1, 2, 3, 4};\n    try stdout.print(\"Type of array object: {}\", .{@TypeOf(simple_array)});\n    try stdout.print(\n        \"Type of string object: {}\",\n        .{@TypeOf(string_literal)}\n    );\n    try stdout.print(\n        \"Type of a pointer that points to the array object: {}\",\n        .{@TypeOf(&simple_array)}\n    );\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nType of array object: [4]i32\nType of string object: *const [43:0]u8\nType of a pointer that points to\n    the array object: *const [4]i32\n```\n\n\n### Byte vs unicode points\n\nIs important to point out that each byte in the array is not necessarily a single character.\nThis fact arises from the difference between a single byte and a single unicode point.\n\nThe encoding UTF-8 works by assigning a number (which is called a unicode point) to each character in\nthe string. For example, the character \"H\" is stored in UTF-8 as the decimal number 72. This means that\nthe number 72 is the unicode point for the character \"H\". Each possible character that can appear in a\nUTF-8 encoded string have its own unicode point.\n\nFor example, the Latin Capital Letter A With Stroke (Ⱥ) is represented by the number (or the unicode point)\n570. However, this decimal number (570) is higher than the maximum number stored inside a single byte, which\nis 255. In other words, the maximum decimal number that can be represented with a single byte is 255. That is why,\nthe unicode point 570 is actually stored inside the computer’s memory as the bytes `C8 BA`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_literal = \"Ⱥ\";\n    try stdout.print(\"Bytes that represents the string object: \", .{});\n    for (string_literal) |char| {\n        try stdout.print(\"{X} \", .{char});\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBytes that represents the string object: C8 BA \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis means that to store the character Ⱥ in an UTF-8 encoded string, we need to use two bytes together\nto represent the number 570. That is why the relationship between bytes and unicode points is not always\n1 to 1. Each unicode point is a single character in the string, but not always a single byte corresponds\nto a single unicode point.\n\nAll of this means that if you loop trough the elements of a string in Zig, you will be looping through the\nbytes that represents that string, and not through the characters of that string. In the Ⱥ example above,\nthe for loop needed two iterations (instead of a single iteration) to print the two bytes that represents this Ⱥ letter.\n\nNow, all english letters (or ASCII letters if you prefer) can be represented by a single byte in UTF-8. As a\nconsequence, if your UTF-8 string contains only english letters (or ASCII letters), then, you are lucky. Because\nthe number of bytes will be equal to the number of characters in that string. In other words, in this specific\nsituation, the relationship between bytes and unicode points is 1 to 1.\n\nBut on the other side, if your string contains other types of letters… for example, you might be working with\ntext data that contains, chinese, japanese or latin letters, then, the number of bytes necessary to represent\nyour UTF-8 string will likely be much higher than the number of characters in that string.\n\nIf you need to iterate through the characters of a string, instead of its bytes, then, you can use the\n`std.unicode.Utf8View` struct to create an iterator that iterates through the unicode points of your string.\n\nIn the example below, we loop through the japanese characters “アメリカ”. Each of the four characters in\nthis string is represented by three bytes. But the for loop iterates four times, one iteration for each\ncharacter/unicode point in this string:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();\npub fn main() !void {\n    var utf8 = (\n        (try std.unicode.Utf8View.init(\"アメリカ\"))\n            .iterator()\n    );\n    while (utf8.nextCodepointSlice()) |codepoint| {\n        try stdout.print(\n            \"got codepoint {}\\n\",\n            .{std.fmt.fmtSliceHexUpper(codepoint)}\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\ngot codepoint E382A2\ngot codepoint E383A1\ngot codepoint E383AA\ngot codepoint E382AB\n```\n\n\n\n## Other parts of Zig\n\nWe already learned a lot about Zig's syntax, and also, some pretty technical\ndetails about it. Just as a quick recap:\n\n- We talked about how functions are written in Zig at @sec-root-file and @sec-main-file.\n- How to create new objects/identifiers at @sec-root-file and specially at @sec-assignments.\n- Basic control flow syntax at @sec-zig-control-flow.\n- How strings work in Zig at @sec-zig-strings.\n- How to use arrays and slices at @sec-arrays.\n- How to import functionality from other Zig modules at @sec-root-file.\n- How Object-Oriented programming can be done in Zig through *Struct declarations* at @sec-structs-and-oop.\n\n\nBut, for now, this amount of knowledge is enough for us to continue with this book.\nLater, over the next chapters we will still talk more about other parts of\nZig's syntax that are also equally important as the other parts. Such as:\n\n- Enums at @sec-enum;\n- Pointers and Optionals at @sec-pointer;\n- Error handling with `try` and `catch`;\n- Unit tests at @sec-unittests;\n- Vectors;\n- Build System;\n\n\n\n\n",
