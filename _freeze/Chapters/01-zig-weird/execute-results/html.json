Some programmers think of\nZig as a modern and better version of C.\n\nIn the author's personal interpretation, Zig is tightly connected with \"less is more\".\nInstead of trying to become a modern language by adding more and more features,\nmany of the core improvements that Zig brings to the\ntable are actually about removing annoying behaviours/features from C and C++.\nIn other words, Zig tries to be better by simplifying the language, and by having more consistent and robust behaviour.\nAs a result, analyzing, writing and debugging applications become much easier and simpler in Zig, than it is in C or C++.\n\nThis philosophy becomes clear with the following phrase from the official website of Zig:\n\n> \"Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge\".\n\nThis phrase is specially true for C++ programmers. Because C++ is a gigantic language,\nwith tons of features, and also, there are lots of different \"flavors of C++\". These elements\nare what makes C++ so complex and hard to learn. Zig tries to go in the opposite direction.\nZig is a very simple language, more closely related to other simple languages such as C and Go.\n\nThe phrase above is still important for C programmers too. Because, even C being a simple\nlanguage, it's still hard sometimes to read and understand C code. For example, pre-processor macros in\nC are a frequent source of confusion. Sometimes, they really make it hard to debug\nC programs. Because macros are essentially a second language embedded in C that obscures\nyour C code. With macros, you are no longer 100% sure about which pieces\nof the code are being sent to the compiler, i.e.\nthey obscure the actual source code that you wrote.\n\nYou don't have macros in Zig. In Zig, the code you write, is the actual code that gets compiled by the compiler.\nYou also don't have a hidden control flow happening behind the scenes. And, you also\ndon't have functions or operators from the standard library that make\nhidden memory allocations behind your back.\n\nBy being a simpler language, Zig becomes much more clear and easier to read/write,\nbut at the same time, it also achieves a much more robust state, with more consistent\nbehaviour in edge situations. Once again, less is more.\n\n\n## Hello world in Zig\n\nWe begin our journey in Zig by creating a small \"Hello World\" program.\nTo start a new Zig project in your computer, you simply call the `init` command\nfrom the `zig` compiler.\nJust create a new directory in your computer, then, init a new Zig project\ninside this directory, like this:\n\n```bash\nmkdir hello_world\ncd hello_world\nzig init\n```\n\n```\ninfo: created build.zig\ninfo: created build.zig.zon\ninfo: created src/main.zig\ninfo: created src/root.zig\ninfo: see `zig build --help` for a menu of options\n```\n\n### Understanding the project files {#sec-project-files}\n\nAfter you run the `init` command from the `zig` compiler, some new files\nare created inside of your current directory. First, a \"source\" (`src`) directory\nis created, containing two files, `main.zig` and `root.zig`. Each `.zig` file\nis a separate Zig module, which is simply a text file that contains some Zig code.\n\nBy convention, the `main.zig` module is where your main function lives. Thus,\nif you are building an executable program in Zig, you need to declare a `main()` function,\nwhich represents the entrypoint of your program, i.e., where the execution of your program begins.\n\nHowever, if you are building a library (instead of an executable program), then,\nthe normal procedure is to delete this `main.zig` file and start with the `root.zig` module.\nBy convention, the `root.zig` module is the root source file of your library.\n\n```bash\ntree .\n```\n\n```\n.\n├── build.zig\n├── build.zig.zon\n└── src\n    ├── main.zig\n    └── root.zig\n\n1 directory, 4 files\n```\n\nThe `init` command also creates two additional files in our working directory:\n`build.zig` and `build.zig.zon`. The first file (`build.zig`) represents a build script written in Zig.\nThis script is executed when you call the `build` command from the `zig` compiler.\nIn other words, this file contains Zig code that executes the necessary steps to build the entire project.\n\n\nLow-level languages normally use a compiler to build your\nsource code into binary executables or binary libraries.\nNevertheless, this process of compiling your source code and building\nbinary executables or binary libraries from it, became a real challenge\nin the programming world, once the projects became bigger and bigger.\nAs a result, programmers created \"build systems\", which are a second set of tools designed to make this process\nof compiling and building complex projects, easier.\n\nExamples of build systems are CMake, GNU Make, GNU Autoconf and Ninja,\nwhich are used to build complex C and C++ projects.\nWith these systems, you can write scripts, which are called \"build scripts\".\nThey simply are scripts that describes the necessary steps to compile/build\nyour project.\n\nHowever, these are separate tools, that do not\nbelong to C/C++ compilers, like `gcc` or `clang`.\nAs a result, in C/C++ projects, you have not only to install and\nmanage your C/C++ compilers, but you also have to install and manage\nthese build systems separately.\n\nIn Zig, we don't need to use a separate set of tools to build our projects,\nbecause a build system is embedded inside the language itself.\nWe can use this build system to write small scripts in Zig,\nwhich describe the necessary steps to build/compile our Zig project[^zig-build-system].\nSo, everything you need to build a complex Zig project is the\n`zig` compiler, and nothing more.\n\n[^zig-build-system]: <https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/#zig-build-system>.\n\n\nThe second generated file (`build.zig.zon`) is a JSON-like file, in which you can describe\nyour project, and also, declare a set of dependencies of your project that you want to fetch from the internet.\nIn other words, you can use this `build.zig.zon` file to include a list of external libraries in your project.\n\nOne possible way to include an external Zig library in your project, is to manually build\nand install the library in your system, and just link your source code\nwith the library at the build step of your project.\n\nHowever, if this external Zig library is available on GitHub for example,\nand it has a valid `build.zig.zon` file in the root folder of the project,\nwhich describes the project, you can easily include this library in\nyour project by simply listing this external library in your `build.zig.zon` file.\n\nIn other words, this `build.zig.zon` file works similarly to the `package.json`\nfile in Javascript projects, or the `Pipfile` file in Python projects,\nor the `Cargo.toml` file in Rust projects. You can read more about this\nspecific file in a couple of articles on the internet[^zig-zon][^zig-zon2], and\nyou can also see the expected schema for this `build.zig.zon` file\nin a documentation file inside the official repository of Zig[^zig-zon-schema].\n\n[^zig-zon]: <https://zig.news/edyu/zig-package-manager-wtf-is-zon-558e>\n[^zig-zon2]: <https://medium.com/@edlyuu/zig-package-manager-2-wtf-is-build-zig-zon-and-build-zig-0-11-0-update-5bc46e830fc1>\n[^zig-zon-schema]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/doc/build.zig.zon.md>\n\n### The file `root.zig` {#sec-root-file}\n\nLet's take a look into the `root.zig` file.\nYou might have noticed that every line of code with an expression ends with a semicolon (`;`).\nThis follows the syntax of a C-family programming language[^c-family].\n\n[^c-family]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages>\n\nAlso, notice the `@import()` call at the first line. We use this built-in function\nto import functionality from other Zig modules into our current module.\nThis `@import()` function works similarly to the `#include` pre-processor\nin C or C++, or, to the `import` statement in Python or Javascript code.\nIn this example, we are importing the `std` module,\nwhich gives you access to the Zig Standard Library.\n\nIn this `root.zig` file, we can also see how assignments (i.e., creating new objects)\nare made in Zig. You can create a new object in Zig by using the syntax\n`(const|var) name = value;`. In the example below, we are creating two constant\nobjects (`std` and `testing`). In @sec-assignments we talk more about objects in general.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst testing = std.testing;\n\nexport fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {\n    return a + b;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nFunctions in Zig are declared using the `fn` keyword.\nIn this `root.zig` module, we are declaring a function called `add()`, which has two arguments named `a` and `b`.\nThe function returns an integer of the type `i32` as result.\n\n\nZig is a strongly-typed language. There are some specific situations where you can (if you want to) omit\nthe type of an object in your code, if this type can be inferred by the `zig` compiler (we talk more\nabout that in @sec-type-inference). But there are other situations where you do need to be explicit.\nFor example, you do have to explicitly specify the type of each function argument, and also,\nthe return type of every function that you create in Zig.\n\nWe specify the type of an object or a function argument in Zig by\nusing a colon character (`:`) followed by the type after the name of this object/function argument.\nWith the expressions `a: i32` and `b: i32`, we know that both `a` and `b` arguments have type `i32`,\nwhich is a signed 32 bit integer. In this part,\nthe syntax in Zig is identical to the syntax in Rust, which also specifies types by\nusing the colon character.\n\nLastly, we have the return type of the function at the end of the line, before we open\nthe curly braces to start writing the function's body. In the example above, this type is also\na signed 32 bit integer (`i32`) value.\n\nNotice that we also have an `export` keyword before the function declaration. This keyword\nis similar to the `extern` keyword in C. It exposes the function\nto make it available in the library API. Therefore, if you are writing\na library for other people to use, you have to expose the functions\nyou write in the public API of this library by using this `export` keyword.\nIf we removed the `export` keyword from the `add()` function declaration,\nthen, this function would be no longer exposed in the library object built\nby the `zig` compiler.\n\n\n### The `main.zig` file {#sec-main-file}\n\nNow that we have learned a lot about Zig's syntax from the `root.zig` file,\nlet's take a look at the `main.zig` file.\nA lot of the elements we saw in `root.zig` are also present in `main.zig`.\nBut there are some other elements that we haven't seen yet, so let's dive in.\n\nFirst, look at the return type of the `main()` function in this file.\nWe can see a small change. The return type of the function (`void`) is accompanied by an exclamation mark (`!`).\nThis exclamation mark tells us that this `main()` function might return an error.\n\nIt's worth noting that, a `main()` function in Zig is allowed to return nothing (`void`),\nor an unsigned 8-bit integer (`u8`) value[^u8-example], or an error. In other words, you can write your `main()` function in Zig\nto return essentially nothing (`void`), or, if you prefer, you can also write a more C-like `main()` function,\nwhich returns an integer value that usually serves as a \"status code\" for the process.\n\n[^u8-example]: You can see an example of a `main()` function that returns a `u8` value in the `return-integer.zig` file, <https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/blob/main/ZigExamples/zig-basics/return-integer.zig>\n\nIn this example, the return type annotation of `main()` indicates that this function can either\nreturn nothing (`void`), or return an error. This exclamation mark in the return type annotation\nis an interesting and powerful feature of Zig. In summary, if you write a function and something inside\nthe body of this function might return an error, then, you are forced to:\n\n- either add the exclamation mark to the return type of the function and make it clear that\nthis function might return an error.\n- explicitly handle this error inside the function.\n\nIn most programming languages, we normally handle (or deal with) an error through\na *try catch* pattern. Zig does have both `try` and `catch` keywords. But they work\na little differently than what you're probably used to in other languages.\n\nIf we look at the `main()` function below, you can see that we do have a `try` keyword\non the 5th line. But we do not have a `catch` keyword in this code.\nIn Zig, we use the `try` keyword to execute an expression that might return an error,\nwhich, in this example, is the `stdout.print()` expression.\n\nIn essence, the `try` keyword executes the expression `stdout.print()`. If this expression\nreturns a valid value, then, the `try` keyword does absolutely nothing. It only passes the value forward.\nIt's like if this `try` keyword was never there. However, if the expression does return an error, then,\nthe `try` keyword will unwrap the error value, then, it returns this error from the function\nand also prints the current stack trace to `stderr`.\n\nThis might sound weird to you if you come from a high-level language. Because in\nhigh-level languages, such as Python, if an error occurs somewhere, this error is automatically\nreturned and the execution of your program will automatically stop even if you don't want\nto stop the execution. You are obligated to face the error.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\n    const stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n    try stdout.print(\"Hello, {s}!\\n\", .{\"world\"});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnother thing that you might have noticed in this code example, is that\nthe `main()` function is marked with the `pub` keyword. It marks the `main()`\nfunction as a *public function* from this module. Every function in your Zig\nmodule is by default private to this Zig module and can only be called from within the module.\nUnless, you explicitly mark this function as a public function with the `pub` keyword.\n\nIf you think about it, this `pub` keyword in Zig does essentially the opposite of what the `static` keyword\ndo in C/C++. By making a function \"public\" you allow other Zig modules to access and call this function.\nA calling Zig module imports another module by using the `@import()` built-in function, which makes\nall public functions from the imported module visible to the calling Zig module.\n\n\n### Compiling your source code {#sec-compile-code}\n\nYou can compile your Zig modules into a binary executable by running the `build-exe` command\nfrom the `zig` compiler. You simply list all the Zig modules that you want to build after\nthe `build-exe` command, separated by spaces. In the example below, we are compiling the module `main.zig`.\n\n```bash\nzig build-exe src/main.zig\n```\n\nSince we are building an executable, the `zig` compiler will look for a `main()` function\ndeclared in any of the files that you list after the `build-exe` command. If\nthe compiler does not find a `main()` function declared somewhere, a\ncompilation error will be raised, warning about this mistake.\n\nThe `zig` compiler also offers a `build-lib` and `build-obj` commands, which work\nthe exact same way as the `build-exe` command. The only difference is that, they compile your\nZig modules into a portable C ABI library, or, into object files, respectively.\n\nIn the case of the `build-exe` command, a binary executable file is created by the `zig`\ncompiler in the root directory of your project.\nIf we take a look now at the contents of our current directory, with a simple `ls` command, we can\nsee the binary file called `main` that was created by the compiler.\n\n```bash\nls\n```\n\n```\nbuild.zig  build.zig.zon  main  src\n```\n\nIf I execute this binary executable, I get the \"Hello World\" message in the terminal\n, as we expected.\n\n```bash\n./main\n```\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n### Compile and execute at the same time {#sec-compile-run-code}\n\nIn the previous section, I presented the `zig build-exe` command, which\ncompiles Zig modules into an executable file. However, this means that,\nin order to execute the executable file, we have to run two different commands.\nFirst, the `zig build-exe` command, and then, we call the executable file\ncreated by the compiler.\n\nBut what if we wanted to perform these two steps,\nall at once, in a single command? We can do that by using the `zig run`\ncommand.\n\n```bash\nzig run src/main.zig\n```\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n### Important note for Windows users\n\nFirst of all, this is a Windows-specific thing, and, therefore, does not apply to other\noperating systems, such as Linux and macOS. In summary, if you have a piece of Zig code that\nincludes some global variables whose initialization rely on runtime resources, then,\nyou might have some troubles while trying to compile this Zig code on Windows.\n\nAn example of that is accessing the `stdout` (i.e., the *standard output* of your system), which is usually\ndone in Zig by using the expression `std.fs.File.stdout()`. If you use this expression to instantiate\na global variable in a Zig module, then, the compilation of your Zig code will very likely fail on Windows,\nwith an \"unable to evaluate comptime expression\" error message.\n\nThis failure in the compilation process happens because all global variables in Zig are initialized\nat *compile-time*. However, on Windows, operations like accessing the `stdout` (or opening a file) depend on\nresources that are available only at *runtime* (you will learn more about compile-time versus runtime\nin @sec-compile-time).\n\nFor example, if you try to compile this code example on Windows, you will likely get the error message\nexposed below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n// ERROR! Compile-time error that emerges from\n// this next line, on the `stdout` object\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    _ = try stdout.write(\"Hello\\n\");\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nt.zig:2107:28: error: unable to evaluate comptime expression\n    break :blk asm {\n               ^~~\n```\n\n\n\nTo avoid this problem on Windows, we need to force the `zig` compiler to instantiate this\n`stdout` object only at runtime, instead of instantiating it at compile-time. We can achieve\nthat by simply moving the expression to a function body.\n\nThis solves the problem because all expressions that are inside a function body in Zig\nare evaluated only at runtime, unless you use the `comptime` keyword explicitly to change this behaviour.\nYou will learn more about this `comptime` keyword in @sec-comptime.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\npub fn main() !void {\n    // SUCCESS: Stdout initialized at runtime.\n    var stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\n    var stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\n    const stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n    _ = try stdout.write(\"Hello\\n\");\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nHello\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can read more details about this Windows-specific limitation in a couple of\nGitHub issues opened at the official Zig repository. More specifically, the issues\n17186 [^cissue1] and 19864 [^cissue2].\n\n[^cissue1]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17186>\n[^cissue2]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19864>\n\n\n### Compiling the entire project {#sec-compile-project}\n\nJust as I described in @sec-project-files, as our project grows in size and\ncomplexity, we usually prefer to organize the compilation and build process\nof the project into a build script, using some sort of \"build system\".\n\nIn other words, as our project grows in size and complexity,\nthe `build-exe`, `build-lib` and `build-obj` commands become\nharder to use directly. Because then, we start to list\nmultiple and multiple modules at the same time. We also\nstart to add built-in compilation flags to customize the\nbuild process for our needs, etc. It becomes a lot of work\nto write the necessary commands by hand.\n\nIn C/C++ projects, programmers normally opt to use CMake, Ninja, `Makefile` or `configure` scripts\nto organize this process. However, in Zig, we have a native build system in the language itself.\nSo, we can write build scripts in Zig to compile and build Zig projects. Then, all we\nneed to do, is to call the `zig build` command to build our project.\n\nSo, when you execute the `zig build` command, the `zig` compiler will search\nfor a Zig module named `build.zig` inside your current directory, which\nshould be your build script, containing the necessary code to compile and\nbuild your project. If the compiler does find this `build.zig` file in your directory,\nthen, the compiler will essentially execute a `zig run` command\nover this `build.zig` file, to compile and execute this build\nscript, which in turn, will compile and build your entire project.\n\n\n```bash\nzig build\n```\n\n\nAfter you execute this \"build project\" command, a `zig-out` directory\nis created in the root of your project directory, where you can find\nthe binary executables and libraries created from your Zig modules\naccordingly to the build commands that you specified at `build.zig`.\nWe will talk more about the build system in Zig later in this book.\n\nIn the example below, I'm executing the binary executable\nnamed `hello_world` that was generated by the compiler after the\n`zig build` command.\n\n```bash\n./zig-out/bin/hello_world\n```\n\n```\nHello, world!\n```\n\n\n\n## How to learn Zig?\n\nWhat are the best strategies to learn Zig?\nFirst of all, of course this book will help you a lot on your journey through Zig.\nBut you will also need some extra resources if you want to be really good at Zig.\n\nAs a first tip, you can join a community with Zig programmers to get some help\n, when you need it:\n\n- Reddit forum: <https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/>;\n- Ziggit community: <https://ziggit.dev/>;\n- Discord, Slack, Telegram, and others: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Community>;\n\nNow, one of the best ways to learn Zig is to simply read Zig code. Try\nto read Zig code often, and things will become more clear.\nA C/C++ programmer would also probably give you this same tip.\nBecause this strategy really works!\n\nNow, where can you find Zig code to read?\nI personally think that, the best way of reading Zig code is to read the source code of the\nZig Standard Library. The Zig Standard Library is available at the [`lib/std` folder](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std)[^zig-lib-std] on\nthe official GitHub repository of Zig. Access this folder, and start exploring the Zig modules.\n\nAlso, a great alternative is to read code from other large Zig\ncodebases, such as:\n\n1. the [Javascript runtime Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)[^bunjs].\n1. the [game engine Mach](https://github.com/hexops/mach)[^mach].\n1. a [LLama 2 LLM model implementation in Zig](https://github.com/cgbur/llama2.zig/tree/main)[^ll2].\n1. the [financial transactions database `tigerbeetle`](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle)[^tiger].\n1. the [command-line arguments parser `zig-clap`](https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap)[^clap].\n1. the [UI framework `capy`](https://github.com/capy-ui/capy)[^capy].\n1. the [Language Protocol implementation for Zig, `zls`](https://github.com/zigtools/zls)[^zls].\n1. the [event-loop library `libxev`](https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev)[^xev].\n\n[^xev]: <https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev>\n[^zls]: <https://github.com/zigtools/zls>\n[^capy]: <https://github.com/capy-ui/capy>\n[^clap]: <https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap>\n[^tiger]: <https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle>\n[^ll2]: <https://github.com/cgbur/llama2.zig/tree/main>\n[^mach]: <https://github.com/hexops/mach>\n[^bunjs]: <https://github.com/oven-sh/bun>.\n\nAll these assets are available on GitHub,\nand this is great, because we can use the GitHub search bar to our advantage,\nto find Zig code that fits our description.\nFor example, you can always include `lang:Zig` in the GitHub search bar when you\nare searching for a particular pattern. This will limit the search to only Zig modules.\n\n[^zig-lib-std]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/lib/std>\n\nAlso, a great alternative is to consult online resources and documentation.\nHere is a quick list of resources that I personally use from time to time to learn\nmore about the language each day:\n\n- Zig Language Reference: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/>;\n- Zig Standard Library Reference: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/>;\n- Zig Guide: <https://zig.guide/>;\n- Karl Seguin Blog: <https://www.openmymind.net/>;\n- Zig News: <https://zig.news/>;\n- Read the code written by one of the Zig core team members: <https://github.com/kubkon>;\n- Some livecoding sessions are transmitted in the Zig Showtime Youtube Channel: <https://www.youtube.com/@ZigSHOWTIME/videos>;\n\n\nAnother great strategy to learn Zig, or honestly, to learn any language you want,\nis to practice it by solving exercises. For example, there is a famous repository\nin the Zig community called [Ziglings](https://ziglings.org)[^ziglings]\n, which contains more than 100 small exercises that you can solve. It's a repository of\ntiny programs written in Zig that are currently broken, and your responsibility is to\nfix these programs, and make them work again.\n\n[^ziglings]: <https://ziglings.org>.\n\nA famous tech YouTuber known as *The Primeagen* also posted some videos (on YouTube)\nwhere he solves these exercises from Ziglings. The first video is named\n[\"Trying Zig Part 1\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuztQfM3Fg&t=2524s&ab_channel=TheVimeagen)[^prime1].\n\n[^prime1]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPuztQfM3Fg&t=2524s&ab_channel=TheVimeagen>.\n\nAnother great alternative, is to solve the [Advent of Code exercises](https://adventofcode.com/)[^advent-code].\nThere are people that already took the time to learn and solve the exercises, and they posted\ntheir solutions on GitHub as well, so, in case you need some resource to compare while solving\nthe exercises, you can look at these two repositories:\n\n- <https://github.com/SpexGuy/Zig-AoC-Template>;\n- <https://github.com/fjebaker/advent-of-code-2022>;\n\n[^advent-code]: <https://adventofcode.com/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Creating new objects in Zig (i.e., identifiers) {#sec-assignments}\n\nLet's talk more about objects in Zig. Readers that have past experience\nwith other programming languages might know this concept through\na different name, such as: \"variable\" or \"identifier\". In this book, I choose\nto use the term \"object\" to refer to this concept.\n\nTo create a new object (or a new \"identifier\") in Zig, we use\nthe keywords `const` or `var`. These keywords specify if the object\nthat you are creating is mutable or not.\nIf you use `const`, then the object you are\ncreating is a constant (or immutable) object, which means that once you declare this object, you\ncan no longer change the value stored inside this object.\n\nOn the other side, if you use `var`, then, you are creating a variable (or mutable) object.\nYou can change the value of this object as many times you want. Using the\nkeyword `var` in Zig is similar to using the keywords `let mut` in Rust.\n\n### Constant objects vs variable objects\n\nIn the code example below, we are creating a new constant object called `age`.\nThis object stores a number representing the age of someone. However, this code example\ndoes not compile successfully. Because on the next line of code, we are trying to change the value\nof the object `age` to 25.\n\nThe `zig` compiler detects that we are trying to change\nthe value of an object/identifier that is constant, and because of that,\nthe compiler will raise a compilation error, warning us about the mistake.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst age = 24;\n// The line below is not valid!\nage = 25;\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nt.zig:10:5: error: cannot assign to constant\n    age = 25;\n      ~~^~~\n```\n\nSo, if you want to change the value of your object, you need to transform your immutable (or \"constant\")\nobject into a mutable (or \"variable\") object. You can do that by using the `var` keyword.\nThis keyword stands for \"variable\", and when you apply this keyword to some object, you are\ntelling the Zig compiler that the value associated with this object might change at some point.\n\nThus, if we come back to the previous example, and change the declaration of the\n`age` object to use the `var` keyword, then, the program gets compiled successfully.\nBecause now, the `zig` compiler detects that we are changing the value of an\nobject that allows this behaviour, because it's a \"variable object\".\n\nHowever, if you take a look at the example below, you will notice that we have not only declared the\n`age` object with the `var` keyword, but we also have explicitly annotated the data type\nof the `age` object with the `u8` type this time. The basic idea is, when we use a variable/mutable object,\nthe Zig compiler ask for us to be more explicit with what we want, to be more clear\nabout what our code does. This translates into being more explicit about the data types that we want\nto use in our objects.\n\nTherefore, if you transform your object into a variable/mutable object, just remember to always\nannotate the type of the object explicitly in your code. Otherwise, the Zig compiler might raise\na compilation error, asking you to transform your object back into a `const` object, or,\nto give your object an \"explicit type\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar age: u8 = 24;\nage = 25;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Declaring without an initial value\n\nBy default, when you declare a new object in Zig, you must give it\nan initial value. In other words, this means\nthat we have to declare, and, at the same time, initialize every object we\ncreate in our source code.\n\nOn the other hand, you can, in fact, declare a new object in your source code,\nand not give it an explicit value. But we need to use a special keyword for that,\nwhich is the `undefined` keyword.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that, you should avoid using `undefined` as much as possible.\nBecause when you use this keyword, you leave your object uninitialized, and, as a consequence,\nif for some reason, your code uses this object while it's uninitialized, then, you will definitely\nhave undefined behaviour and major bugs in your program.\n\nIn the example below, I'm declaring the `age` object again. But this time,\nI do not give it an initial value. The variable is only initialized at\nthe second line of code, where I store the number 25 in this object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar age: u8 = undefined;\nage = 25;\n```\n:::\n\n\nHaving these points in mind, just remember that you should avoid as much as possible to use `undefined` in your code.\nAlways declare and initialize your objects. Because this gives you much more safety in your program.\nBut in case you really need to declare an object without initializing it... the\n`undefined` keyword is the way to do it in Zig.\n\n\n### There is no such thing as unused objects\n\nEvery object (being constant or variable) that you declare in Zig **must be used in some way**. You can give this object\nto a function call, as a function argument, or, you can use it in another expression\nto calculate the value of another object, or, you can call a method that belongs to this\nparticular object.\n\nIt doesn't matter in which way you use it. As long as you use it.\nIf you try to break this rule, i.e., if your try to declare a object, but not use it,\nthe `zig` compiler will not compile your Zig source code, and it will issue a error\nmessage warning that you have unused objects in your code.\n\nLet's demonstrate this with an example. In the source code below, we declare a constant object\ncalled `age`. If you try to compile a simple Zig program with this line of code below,\nthe compiler will return an error as demonstrated below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst age = 15;\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nt.zig:4:11: error: unused local constant\n    const age = 15;\n          ^~~\n```\n\nEverytime you declare a new object in Zig, you have two choices:\n\n1. you either use the value of this object;\n1. or you explicitly discard the value of the object;\n\nTo explicitly discard the value of any object (constant or variable), all you need to do is to assign\nthis object to a special character in Zig, which is the underscore (`_`).\nWhen you assign an object to a underscore, like in the example below, the `zig` compiler will automatically\ndiscard the value of this particular object.\n\nYou can see in the example below that, this time, the compiler did not\ncomplain about any \"unused constant\", and successfully compiled our source code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// It compiles!\nconst age = 15;\n_ = age;\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, remember, everytime you assign a particular object to the underscore, this object\nis essentially destroyed. It's discarded by the compiler. This means that you can no longer\nuse this object further in your code. It doesn't exist anymore.\n\nSo if you try to use the constant `age` in the example below, after we discarded it, you\nwill get a loud error message from the compiler (talking about a \"pointless discard\")\nwarning you about this mistake.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// It does not compile.\nconst age = 15;\n_ = age;\n// Using a discarded value!\nstd.debug.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{age + 2});\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nt.zig:7:5: error: pointless discard\n    of local constant\n```\n\n\nThis same rule applies to variable objects. Every variable object must also be used in\nsome way. And if you assign a variable object to the underscore,\nthis object also gets discarded, and you can no longer use this object.\n\n\n\n### You must mutate every variable objects\n\nEvery variable object that you create in your source code must be mutated at some point.\nIn other words, if you declare an object as a variable\nobject, with the keyword `var`, and you do not change the value of this object\nat some point in the future, the `zig` compiler will detect this,\nand it will raise an error warning you about this mistake.\n\nThe concept behind this is that every object you create in Zig should be preferably a\nconstant object, unless you really need an object whose value will\nchange during the execution of your program.\n\nSo, if I try to declare a variable object such as `where_i_live` below,\nand I do not change the value of this object in some way,\nthe `zig` compiler raises an error message with the phrase \"variable is never mutated\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar where_i_live = \"Belo Horizonte\";\n_ = where_i_live;\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nt.zig:7:5: error: local variable is never mutated\nt.zig:7:5: note: consider using 'const'\n```\n\n## Primitive Data Types {#sec-primitive-data-types}\n\nZig has many different primitive data types available for you to use.\nYou can see the full list of available data types at the official\n[Language Reference page](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Primitive-Types)[^lang-data-types].\n\n[^lang-data-types]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Primitive-Types>.\n\nBut here is a quick list:\n\n- Unsigned integers: `u8`, 8-bit integer; `u16`, 16-bit integer; `u32`, 32-bit integer; `u64`, 64-bit integer; `u128`, 128-bit integer.\n- Signed integers: `i8`, 8-bit integer; `i16`, 16-bit integer; `i32`, 32-bit integer; `i64`, 64-bit integer; `i128`, 128-bit integer.\n- Float number: `f16`, 16-bit floating point; `f32`, 32-bit floating point; `f64`, 64-bit floating point; `f128`, 128-bit floating point;\n- Boolean: `bool`, represents true or false values.\n- C ABI compatible types: `c_long`, `c_char`, `c_short`, `c_ushort`, `c_int`, `c_uint`, and many others.\n- Pointer sized integers: `isize` and `usize`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Arrays {#sec-arrays}\n\nYou create arrays in Zig by using a syntax that resembles the C syntax.\nFirst, you specify the size of the array (i.e., the number of elements that will be stored in the array)\nyou want to create inside a pair of brackets.\n\nThen, you specify the data type of the elements that will be stored inside this array.\nAll elements present in an array in Zig must have the same data type. For example, you cannot mix elements\nof type `f32` with elements of type `i32` in the same array.\n\nAfter that, you simply list the values that you want to store in this array inside\na pair of curly braces.\nIn the example below, I am creating two constant objects that contain different arrays.\nThe first object contains an array of 4 integer values, while the second object,\nan array of 3 floating point values.\n\nNow, you should notice that in the object `ls`, I am\nnot explicitly specifying the size of the array inside of the brackets. Instead\nof using a literal value (like the value 4 that I used in the `ns` object), I am\nusing the special character underscore (`_`). This syntax tells the `zig` compiler\nto fill this field with the number of elements listed inside of the curly braces.\nSo, this syntax `[_]` is for lazy (or smart) programmers who leave the job of\ncounting how many elements there are in the curly braces for the compiler.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst ls = [_]f64{432.1, 87.2, 900.05};\n_ = ns; _ = ls;\n```\n:::\n\n\nIt's worth noting that these are static arrays, meaning that\nthey cannot grow in size.\nOnce you declare your array, you cannot change the size of it.\nThis is very common in low level languages.\nBecause low level languages normally wants to give you (the programmer) full control over memory,\nand the way in which arrays are expanded is tightly related to\nmemory management.\n\n\n### Selecting elements of the array {#sec-select-array-elem}\n\nOne very common activity is to select specific portions of an array\nyou have in your source code.\nIn Zig, you can select a specific element from your\narray, by simply providing the index of this particular\nelement inside brackets after the object name.\nIn the example below, I am selecting the third element from the\n`ns` array. Notice that Zig is a \"zero-index\" based language,\nlike C, C++, Rust, Python, and many other languages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\ntry stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{ ns[2] });\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n12\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn contrast, you can also select specific slices (or sections) of your array, by using a\nrange selector. Some programmers also call these selectors of \"slice selectors\",\nand they also exist in Rust, and have the exact same syntax as in Zig.\nAnyway, a range selector is a special expression in Zig that defines\na range of indexes, and it has the syntax `start..end`.\n\nIn the example below, at the second line of code,\nthe `sl` object stores a slice (or a portion) of the\n`ns` array. More precisely, the elements at index 1 and 2\nin the `ns` array.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ns[1..3];\n_ = sl;\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen you use the `start..end` syntax,\nthe \"end tail\" of the range selector is non-inclusive,\nmeaning that, the index at the end is not included in the range that is\nselected from the array.\nTherefore, the syntax `start..end` actually means `start..end - 1` in practice.\n\nYou can for example, create a slice that goes from the first to the\nlast elements of the array, by using `ar[0..ar.len]` syntax\nIn other words, it's a slice that\naccesses all elements in the array.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ar = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ar[0..ar.len];\n_ = sl;\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can also use the syntax `start..` in your range selector.\nWhich tells the `zig` compiler to select the portion of the array\nthat begins at the `start` index until the last element of the array.\nIn the example below, we are selecting the range from index 1\nuntil the end of the array.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ns[1..];\n_ = sl;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### More on slices\n\nAs we discussed before, in Zig, you can select specific portions of an existing\narray. This is called *slicing* in Zig [@zigguide], because when you select a portion\nof an array, you are creating a slice object from that array.\n\nA slice object is essentially a pointer object accompanied by a length number.\nThe pointer object points to the first element in the slice, and the\nlength number tells the `zig` compiler how many elements there are in this slice.\n\n> Slices can be thought of as a pair of `[*]T` (the pointer to the data) and a `usize` (the element count) [@zigguide].\n\nThrough the pointer contained inside the slice you can access the elements (or values)\nthat are inside this range (or portion) that you selected from the original array.\nBut the length number (which you can access through the `len` property of your slice object)\nis the really big improvement (over C arrays for example) that Zig brings to the table here.\n\nBecause with this length number\nthe `zig` compiler can easily check if you are trying to access an index that is out of the bounds of this particular slice,\nor, if you are causing any buffer overflow problems. In the example below,\nwe access the `len` property of the slice `sl`, which tells us that this slice\nhas 2 elements in it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst ns = [4]u8{48, 24, 12, 6};\nconst sl = ns[1..3];\ntry stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{sl.len});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Array operators\n\nThere are two array operators available in Zig that are very useful.\nThe array concatenation operator (`++`), and the array multiplication operator (`**`). As the name suggests,\nthese are array operators.\n\nOne important detail about these two operators is that they work\nonly when both operands have a size (or \"length\") that is compile-time known.\nWe are going to talk more about\nthe differences between \"compile-time known\" and \"runtime known\" in @sec-compile-time.\nBut for now, keep this information in mind, that you cannot use these operators in every situation.\n\nIn summary, the `++` operator creates a new array that is the concatenation,\nof both arrays provided as operands. So, the expression `a ++ b` produces\na new array which contains all the elements from arrays `a` and `b`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst a = [_]u8{1,2,3};\nconst b = [_]u8{4,5};\nconst c = a ++ b;\ntry stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{c});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis `++` operator is particularly useful to concatenate strings together.\nStrings in Zig are described in depth in @sec-zig-strings. In summary, a string object in Zig\nis essentially an array of bytes. So, you can use this array concatenation operator\nto effectively concatenate strings together.\n\nIn contrast, the `**` operator is used to replicate an array multiple\ntimes. In other words, the expression `a ** 3` creates a new array\nwhich contains the elements of the array `a` repeated 3 times.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst a = [_]u8{1,2,3};\nconst c = a ** 2;\ntry stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{c});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n{ 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Runtime versus compile-time known length in slices\n\nWe are going to talk a lot about the differences between compile-time known\nand runtime known across this book, especially in @sec-compile-time.\nBut the basic idea is that a thing is compile-time known, when we know\neverything (the value, the attributes and the characteristics) about this thing at compile-time.\nIn contrast, a runtime known thing is when the exact value of a thing is calculated only at runtime.\nTherefore, we don't know the value of this thing at compile-time, only at runtime.\n\nWe have learned in @sec-select-array-elem that slices are created by using a *range selector*,\nwhich represents a range of indexes. When this \"range of indexes\" (i.e., both the start and the end of this range)\nis known at compile-time, the slice object that gets created is actually, under the hood, just\na single-item pointer to an array.\n\nYou don't need to precisely understand what that means now. We are going to talk a lot about pointers\nin @sec-pointer. For now, just understand that, when the range of indexes is known at compile-time,\nthe slice that gets created is just a pointer to an array, accompanied by a length value that\ntells the size of the slice.\n\nIf you have a slice object like this, i.e., a slice that has a compile-time known range,\nyou can use common pointer operations over this slice object. For example, you can\ndereference the pointer of this slice, by using the `.*` method, like you would\ndo on a normal pointer object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst arr1 = [10]u64 {\n    1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\n    6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n};\n// This slice has a compile-time known range.\n// Because we know both the start and end of the range.\nconst slice = arr1[1..4];\n_ = slice;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if the range of indexes is not known at compile time, then, the slice object\nthat gets created is not a pointer anymore, and, thus, it does not support pointer operations.\nFor example, maybe the start index is known at compile time, but the end index is not. In such\ncase, the range of the slice becomes runtime known only.\n\nIn the example below, we are reading a file, and then, we try to create a slice object\nthat covers the entire buffer that contains the contents of this file. This is obviously\nan example of a runtime known range, because the end index of the range\nis not known at compile time.\n\nIn other words, the end index of the range is the size of\nthe array `file_contents`. However, the size of `file_contents` is not known at compile time.\nBecause we don't know how many bytes are stored inside this `shop-list.txt` file.\nAnd because this is a file, someone might edit this file tomorrow and add more lines\nor remove lines from it. Therefore, the size of this file might vary drastically from one execution to another.\n\nNow, if the file size can vary from one run to another, then, we can conclude that the value of the expression\n`file_contents.len` exposed in the example below can also vary from one run to another. As consequence,\nthe value of the expression `file_contents.len` is runtime-known only, and, as a consequence of that,\nthe range `0..file_contents.len` is also runtime-known only.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nconst builtin = @import(\"builtin\");\n\nfn read_file(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, path: []const u8) ![]u8 {\n    const file = try std.fs.cwd().openFile(path, .{});\n    defer file.close();\n\n    var file_buffer = try allocator.alloc(u8, 1024);\n    @memset(file_buffer[0..], 0);\n\n    const nbytes = try file.read(file_buffer[0..]);\n    return file_buffer[0..nbytes];\n}\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var gpa = std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator(.{}){};\n    const allocator = gpa.allocator();\n    const path = \"../ZigExamples/file-io/shop-list.txt\";\n    const file_contents = try read_file(allocator, path);\n    const slice = file_contents[0..file_contents.len];\n    _ = slice;\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Blocks and scopes {#sec-blocks}\n\nBlocks are created in Zig by a pair of curly braces. A block is just a group of\nexpressions (or statements) contained inside of a pair of curly braces. All of these expressions that\nare contained inside of this pair of curly braces belongs to the same scope.\n\nIn other words, a block just delimits a scope in your code.\nThe objects that you define inside the same block belongs to the same\nscope, and, therefore, are accessible from within this scope.\nAt the same time, these objects are not accessible outside of this scope.\nSo, you could also say that blocks are used to limit the scope of the objects that you create in\nyour source code. In less technical terms, blocks are used to specify where in your source code\nyou can access whatever object you have in your source code.\n\nSo, a block is just a group of expressions contained inside a pair of curly braces.\nAnd every block have its own scope separated from the others.\nThe body of a function is a classic example of a block. If statements, for and while loops\n(and any other structure in the language that uses the pair of curly braces)\nare also examples of blocks.\n\nThis means that, every if statement, or for loop,\netc., that you create in your source code has its own separate scope.\nThat is why you can't access the objects that you defined inside\nof your for loop (or if statement) in an outer scope, i.e., a scope outside of the for loop.\nBecause you are trying to access an object that belongs to a scope that is different\nthan your current scope.\n\n\nYou can create blocks within blocks, with multiple levels of nesting.\nYou can also (if you want to) give a label to a particular block, with the colon character (`:`).\nJust write `label:` before you open the pair of curly braces that delimits your block. When you label a block\nin Zig, you can use the `break` keyword to return a value from this block, like as if it\nwas a function's body. You just write the `break` keyword, followed by the block label in the format `:label`,\nand the expression that defines the value that you want to return.\n\nLike in the example below, where we are returning the value from the `y` object\nfrom the block `add_one`, and saving the result inside the `x` object.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nvar y: i32 = 123;\nconst x = add_one: {\n    y += 1;\n    break :add_one y;\n};\nif (x == 124 and y == 124) {\n    try stdout.print(\"Hey!\", .{});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nHey!\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## How strings work in Zig? {#sec-zig-strings}\n\nThe first project that we are going to build and discuss in this book is a base64 encoder/decoder (@sec-base64).\nBut in order for us to build such a thing, we need to get a better understanding on how strings work in Zig.\nSo let's discuss this specific aspect of Zig.\n\nStrings in Zig work very similarly to strings in C, but they come with some extra caveats which adds more safety\nand efficiency to them. You could also say that Zig simply uses a more modern and safe approach to manage\nand use strings.\n\nA string in Zig is essentially an array of arbitrary bytes, or, more specifically, an array of `u8` values.\nThis very similar to a string in C, which is also interpreted as an array of arbitrary bytes, or, in the case\nof C, an array of `char` (which usually represents an unsigned 8-bit integer value in most systems) values.\n\nNow, because a string in Zig is an array, you automatically\nget the length of the string (i.e. the length of the array) embedded in the value itself. This makes\nall the difference! Because now, the Zig compiler can use the length value that is embedded in the string to\ncheck for \"buffer overflow\" or \"wrong memory access\" problems in your code.\n\n\nTo achieve this same kind of safety in C, you have to do a lot of work that kind of seems pointless.\nSo getting this kind of safety is not automatic and much harder to do in C. For example, if you want\nto track the length of your string throughout your program in C, then, you first need to loop through\nthe array of bytes that represents this string, and find the null element (`'\\0'`) position to discover\nwhere exactly the array ends, or, in other words, to find how much elements the array of bytes contain.\n\nTo do that, you would need to do something like this in C. In this example, the C string stored in\nthe object `array` is 25 bytes long:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.c .cell-code}\n#include <stdio.h>\nint main() {\n    char* array = \"An example of string in C\";\n    int index = 0;\n    while (1) {\n        if (array[index] == '\\0') {\n            break;\n        }\n        index++;\n    }\n    printf(\"Number of elements in the array: %d\\n\", index);\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nNumber of elements in the array: 25\n```\n\n\nYou don't have this kind of work in Zig. Because the length of the string is always\npresent and accessible in the string value itself. You can easily access the length of the string\nthrough the `len` attribute. As an example, the `string_object` object below is 43 bytes long:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_object = \"This is an example of string literal in Zig\";\n    try stdout.print(\"{d}\\n\", .{string_object.len});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n43\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnother point is that Zig always assumes that the sequence of bytes in your string is UTF-8 encoded. This might not be true for every\nsequence of bytes you're working with, but it's not really Zig's job to fix the encoding of your strings\n(you can use [`iconv`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/)[^libiconv] for that).\nToday, most of the text in our modern world, especially on the web, should be UTF-8 encoded.\nSo if your string literal is not UTF-8 encoded, then, you will likely have problems in Zig.\n\n[^libiconv]: <https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>\n\nLet's take for example the word \"Hello\". In UTF-8, this sequence of characters (H, e, l, l, o)\nis represented by the sequence of decimal numbers 72, 101, 108, 108, 111. In hexadecimal, this\nsequence is `0x48`, `0x65`, `0x6C`, `0x6C`, `0x6F`. So if I take this sequence of hexadecimal values,\nand ask Zig to print this sequence of bytes as a sequence of characters (i.e., a string), then,\nthe text \"Hello\" will be printed into the terminal:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const bytes = [_]u8{0x48, 0x65, 0x6C, 0x6C, 0x6F};\n    try stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{bytes});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nHello\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Using a slice versus a sentinel-terminated array\n\nIn memory, all string values in Zig are always stored in the same way.\nThey are simply stored as sequences/arrays of arbitrary bytes. But you can use and access\nthis sequence of bytes in two different ways. You can access this sequence of bytes as:\n\n- a sentinel-terminated array of `u8` values.\n- or as a slice of `u8` values.\n\n\n#### Sentinel-terminated arrays\n\nSentinel-terminated arrays in Zig are described in the Language Reference of Zig[^sentinel].\nIn summary a sentinel-terminated array is just a normal array, but, the difference is that they\ncontain a \"sentinel value\" at the last index/element of the array. With a sentinel-terminated array\nyou embed both the length of the array, and also, the sentinel value in the type itself of your object.\n\n[^sentinel]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Sentinel-Terminated-Arrays>.\n\nFor example, if you write a string literal value in your code, and ask Zig to print the data type of this value,\nyou usually get a data type in the format `*const [n:0]u8`. The `n` in the data type indicates the size of\nthe string (that is the length of the array). The zero after the `n:` part of the data type is the sentinel\nvalue itself.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// This is a string literal value:\n_ = \"A literal value\";\ntry stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{@TypeOf(\"A literal value\")});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n*const [15:0]u8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, with this data type `*const [n:0]u8` you are essentially saying that you have an array of `u8` values\nof length `n`, where, the element at the index corresponding to the length `n` in the array is the\nnumber zero. If you really think about this description, you will notice that this is just a fancy way to\ndescribe a string in C, which is a null-terminated array of bytes. The `NULL` value in C is the number\nzero. So, an array that ends in a null/zero value in C is essentially a sentinel-terminated array in Zig,\nwhere the sentinel value of the array is the number zero.\n\nTherefore, a string literal value in Zig is just a pointer to a null-terminated array of bytes (i.e., similar to a C string).\nBut in Zig, a string literal value also embeds the length of the string, and also, the fact that they are \"NULL terminated\",\ninto the data type of the value itself.\n\n\n\n#### Slice\n\nYou can also access and use the arbitrary sequence of bytes that represent your string as a slice of `u8` values.\nThe majority of functions from the Zig standard library usually receive strings as inputs as slices of\n`u8` values (slices were presented in @sec-arrays).\n\nThus, you will see a lot of string values with a data type of `[]u8` or `[]const u8`, depending if the object\nwhere this string is stored is marked as constant with `const`, or as variable with `var`. Now, because\nthe string in this case is being interpreted as a slice, this slice is not necessarilly null-terminated,\nbecause now, the sentinel value is not mandatory. You can include the null/zero value in the slice if you\nwant to, but there is no need to do it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\n// This is a string value being\n// interpreted as a slice.\nconst str: []const u8 = \"A string value\";\ntry stdout.print(\"{any}\\n\", .{@TypeOf(str)});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[]const u8\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Iterating through the string\n\nIf you want to see the actual bytes that represents a string in Zig, you can use\na `for` loop to iterate through each byte in the string, and ask Zig to print each byte as a hexadecimal\nvalue to the terminal. You do that by using a `print()` statement with the `X` formatting specifier,\nlike you would normally do with the [`printf()` function](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/)[^printfs] in C.\n\n[^printfs]: <https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_object = \"This is an example\";\n    try stdout.print(\"Bytes that represents the string object: \", .{});\n    for (string_object) |byte| {\n        try stdout.print(\"{X} \", .{byte});\n    }\n    try stdout.print(\"\\n\", .{});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBytes that represents the string object: 54 68 69 \n   73 20 69 73 20 61 6E 20 65 78 61 6D 70 6C 65 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### A better look at the object type\n\nNow, we can inspect better the type of objects that Zig create. To check the type of any object in Zig, you can use the\n`@TypeOf()` function. If we look at the type of the `simple_array` object below, you will find that this object\nis an array of 4 elements. Each element is a signed integer of 32 bits which corresponds to the data type `i32` in Zig.\nThat is what an object of type `[4]i32` is.\n\nBut if we look closely at the type of the string literal value exposed below, you will find that this object is a\nconstant pointer (hence the `*const` annotation) to an array of 16 elements (or 16 bytes). Each element is a\nsingle byte (more precisely, an unsigned 8 bit integer - `u8`), that is why we have the `[16:0]u8` portion of the type below,\nand also, you can see that this is a null-terminated array, because of the zero value after the `:` character in the data type.\nIn other words, the string literal value exposed below is 16 bytes long.\n\nNow, if we create a pointer to the `simple_array` object, then, we get a constant pointer to an array of 4 elements (`*const [4]i32`),\nwhich is very similar to the type of the string literal value. This demonstrates that a string literal value\nin Zig is already a pointer to a null-terminated array of bytes.\n\nFurthermore, if we take a look at the type of the `string_obj` object, you will see that it's a\nslice object (hence the `[]` portion of the type) to a sequence of constant `u8` values (hence\nthe `const u8` portion of the type).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\npub fn main() !void {\n    const simple_array = [_]i32{1, 2, 3, 4};\n    const string_obj: []const u8 = \"A string object\";\n    std.debug.print(\n        \"Type 1: {}\\n\", .{@TypeOf(simple_array)}\n    );\n    std.debug.print(\n        \"Type 2: {}\\n\", .{@TypeOf(\"A string literal\")}\n    );\n    std.debug.print(\n        \"Type 3: {}\\n\", .{@TypeOf(&simple_array)}\n    );\n    std.debug.print(\n        \"Type 4: {}\\n\", .{@TypeOf(string_obj)}\n    );\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nType 1: [4]i32\nType 2: *const [16:0]u8\nType 3: *const [4]i32\nType 4: []const u8\n```\n\n\n\n### Byte vs unicode points\n\nIt's important to point out that each byte in the array is not necessarily a single character.\nThis fact arises from the difference between a single byte and a single unicode point.\n\nThe encoding UTF-8 works by assigning a number (which is called a unicode point) to each character in\nthe string. For example, the character \"H\" is stored in UTF-8 as the decimal number 72. This means that\nthe number 72 is the unicode point for the character \"H\". Each possible character that can appear in a\nUTF-8 encoded string have its own unicode point.\n\nFor example, the Latin Capital Letter A With Stroke (Ⱥ) is represented by the number (or the unicode point)\n570. However, this decimal number (570) is higher than the maximum number stored inside a single byte, which\nis 255. In other words, the maximum decimal number that can be represented with a single byte is 255. That is why,\nthe unicode point 570 is actually stored inside the computer’s memory as the bytes `C8 BA`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    const string_object = \"Ⱥ\";\n    _ = try stdout.write(\n        \"Bytes that represents the string object: \"\n    );\n    for (string_object) |char| {\n        try stdout.print(\"{X} \", .{char});\n    }\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nBytes that represents the string object: C8 BA \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis means that to store the character Ⱥ in a UTF-8 encoded string, we need to use two bytes together\nto represent the number 570. That is why the relationship between bytes and unicode points is not always\n1 to 1. Each unicode point is a single character in the string, but not always a single byte corresponds\nto a single unicode point.\n\nAll of this means that if you loop through the elements of a string in Zig, you will be looping through the\nbytes that represents that string, and not through the characters of that string. In the Ⱥ example above,\nthe for loop needed two iterations (instead of a single iteration) to print the two bytes that represents this Ⱥ letter.\n\nNow, all english letters (or ASCII letters if you prefer) can be represented by a single byte in UTF-8. As a\nconsequence, if your UTF-8 string contains only english letters (or ASCII letters), then, you are lucky. Because\nthe number of bytes will be equal to the number of characters in that string. In other words, in this specific\nsituation, the relationship between bytes and unicode points is 1 to 1.\n\nBut on the other side, if your string contains other types of letters… for example, you might be working with\ntext data that contains, chinese, japanese or latin letters, then, the number of bytes necessary to represent\nyour UTF-8 string will likely be much higher than the number of characters in that string.\n\nIf you need to iterate through the characters of a string, instead of its bytes, then, you can use the\n`std.unicode.Utf8View` struct to create an iterator that iterates through the unicode points of your string.\n\nIn the example below, we loop through the japanese characters “アメリカ”. Each of the four characters in\nthis string is represented by three bytes. But the for loop iterates four times, one iteration for each\ncharacter/unicode point in this string:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    var utf8 = try std.unicode.Utf8View.init(\"アメリカ\");\n    var iterator = utf8.iterator();\n    while (iterator.nextCodepointSlice()) |codepoint| {\n        try stdout.print(\n            \"got codepoint {x}\\n\",\n            .{codepoint},\n        );\n    }\n\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\ngot codepoint e382a2\ngot codepoint e383a1\ngot codepoint e383aa\ngot codepoint e382ab\n```\n\n\n### Some useful functions for strings {#sec-strings-useful-funs}\n\nIn this section, I just want to quickly describe some functions from the Zig Standard Library\nthat are very useful to use when working with strings. Most notably:\n\n- `std.mem.eql()`: to compare if two strings are equal.\n- `std.mem.splitScalar()`: to split a string into an array of substrings given a delimiter value.\n- `std.mem.splitSequence()`: to split a string into an array of substrings given a substring delimiter.\n- `std.mem.startsWith()`: to check if string starts with substring.\n- `std.mem.endsWith()`: to check if string ends with substring.\n- `std.mem.trim()`: to remove specific values from both start and end of the string.\n- `std.mem.concat()`: to concatenate strings together.\n- `std.mem.count()`: to count the occurrences of substring in the string.\n- `std.mem.replace()`: to replace the occurrences of substring in the string.\n\nNotice that all of these functions come from the `mem` module of\nthe Zig Standard Library. This module contains multiple functions and methods\nthat are useful to work with memory and sequences of bytes in general.\n\nThe `eql()` function is used to check if two arrays of data are equal or not.\nSince strings are just arbitrary arrays of bytes, we can use this function to compare two strings together.\nThis function returns a boolean value indicating if the two strings are equal\nor not. The first argument of this function is the data type of the elements of the arrays\nthat are being compared.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst name: []const u8 = \"Pedro\";\ntry stdout.print(\n    \"{any}\\n\", .{std.mem.eql(u8, name, \"Pedro\")}\n);\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ntrue\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `splitScalar()` and `splitSequence()` functions are useful to split\na string into multiple fragments, like the `split()` method from Python strings. The difference between these two\nmethods is that the `splitScalar()` uses a single character as the separator to\nsplit the string, while `splitSequence()` uses a sequence of characters (a.k.a. a substring)\nas the separator. There is a practical example of these functions later in the book.\n\nThe `startsWith()` and `endsWith()` functions are pretty straightforward. They\nreturn a boolean value indicating if the string (or, more precisely, if the array of data)\nbegins (`startsWith`) or ends (`endsWith`) with the sequence provided.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst name: []const u8 = \"Pedro\";\ntry stdout.print(\n    \"{any}\\n\", .{std.mem.startsWith(u8, name, \"Pe\")}\n);\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\ntrue\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `concat()` function, as the name suggests, concatenate two or more strings together.\nBecause the process of concatenating the strings involves allocating enough space to\naccomodate all the strings together, this `concat()` function receives an allocator\nobject as input.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst str1 = \"Hello\";\nconst str2 = \" you!\";\nconst str3 = try std.mem.concat(\n    allocator, u8, &[_][]const u8{ str1, str2 }\n);\ntry stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{str3});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, the `replace()` function is used to replace substrings in a string by another substring.\nThis function works very similarly to the `replace()` method from Python strings. Therefore, you\nprovide a substring to search, and every time that the `replace()` function finds\nthis substring within the input string, it replaces this substring with the \"replacement substring\"\nthat you provided as input.\n\nIn the example below, we are taking the input string \"Hello\", and replacing all occurrences\nof the substring \"el\" inside this input string with \"34\", and saving the results inside the\n`buffer` object. As result, the `replace()` function returns an `usize` value that\nindicates how many replacements were performed.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst str1 = \"Hello\";\nvar buffer: [5]u8 = undefined;\nconst nrep = std.mem.replace(\n    u8, str1, \"el\", \"34\", buffer[0..]\n);\ntry stdout.print(\"New string: {s}\\n\", .{buffer});\ntry stdout.print(\"N of replacements: {d}\\n\", .{nrep});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nNew string: H34lo\nN of replacements: 1\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Safety in Zig\n\nA general trend in modern low-level programming languages is safety. As our modern world\nbecomes more interconnected with technology and computers,\nthe data produced by all of this technology becomes one of the most important\n(and also, one of the most dangerous) assets that we have.\n\nThis is probably the main reason why modern low-level programming languages\nhave been giving great attention to safety, especially memory safety, because\nmemory corruption is still the main target for hackers to exploit.\nThe reality is that we don't have an easy solution for this problem.\nFor now, we only have techniques and strategies that mitigates these\nproblems.\n\nAs Richard Feldman explains on his [most recent GOTO conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZpKpLCOiU&ab_channel=GOTOConferences)[^gotop]\n, we haven't figured it out yet a way to achieve **true safety in technology**.\nIn other words, we haven't found a way to build software that won't be exploited\nwith 100% certainty. We can greatly reduce the risks of our software being\nexploited, by ensuring memory safety for example. But this is not enough\nto achieve \"true safety\" territory.\n\nBecause even if you write your program in a \"safe language\", hackers can still\nexploit failures in the operating system where your program is running (e.g. maybe the\nsystem where your code is running has a \"backdoor exploit\" that can still\naffect your code in unexpected ways), or also, they can exploit the features\nfrom the architecture of your computer. A recently found exploit\nthat involves memory invalidation through a feature of \"memory tags\"\npresent in ARM chips is an example of that [@exploit1].\n\n[^gotop]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIZpKpLCOiU&ab_channel=GOTOConferences>\n\nThe question is: what have Zig and other languages been doing to mitigate this problem?\nIf we take Rust as an example, Rust is, for the most part[^rust-safe], a memory safe\nlanguage by enforcing specific rules to the developer. In other words, the key feature\nof Rust, the *borrow checker*, forces you to follow a specific logic when you are writing\nyour Rust code, and the Rust compiler will always complain everytime you try to go out of this\npattern.\n\n[^rust-safe]: Actually, a lot of existing Rust code is still memory unsafe, because they communicate with external libraries through FFI (*foreign function interface*), which disables the borrow-checker features through the `unsafe` keyword.\n\n\nIn contrast, the Zig language is not a memory safe language by default.\nThere are some memory safety features that you get for free in Zig,\nespecially in arrays and pointer objects. But there are other tools\noffered by the language, that are not used by default.\nIn other words, the `zig` compiler does not obligate you to use such tools.\n\nThe tools listed below are related to memory safety. That is, they help you to achieve\nmemory safety in your Zig code:\n\n- `defer` allows you to keep free operations physically close to allocations. This helps you to avoid memory leaks, \"use after free\", and also \"double-free\" problems. Furthermore, it also keeps free operations logically tied to the end of the current scope, which greatly reduces the mental overhead about object lifetime.\n- `errdefer` helps you to guarantee that your program frees the allocated memory, even if a runtime error occurs.\n- pointers and objects are non-nullable by default. This helps you to avoid memory problems that might arise from de-referencing null pointers.\n- Zig offers some native types of allocators (called \"testing allocators\") that can detect memory leaks and double-frees. These types of allocators are widely used on unit tests, so they transform your unit tests into a weapon that you can use to detect memory problems in your code.\n- arrays and slices in Zig have their lengths embedded in the object itself, which makes the `zig` compiler very effective on detecting \"index out-of-range\" type of errors, and avoiding buffer overflows.\n\n\nDespite these features that Zig offers that are related to memory safety issues, the language\nalso has some rules that help you to achieve another type of safety, which is more related to\nprogram logic safety. These rules are:\n\n- pointers and objects are non-nullable by default. Which eliminates an edge case that might break the logic of your program.\n- switch statements must exaust all possible options.\n- the `zig` compiler forces you to handle every possible error in your program.\n\n\n## Other parts of Zig\n\nWe already learned a lot about Zig's syntax, and also, some pretty technical\ndetails about it. Just as a quick recap:\n\n- We talked about how functions are written in Zig in @sec-root-file and @sec-main-file.\n- How to create new objects/identifiers in @sec-root-file and especially in @sec-assignments.\n- How strings work in Zig in @sec-zig-strings.\n- How to use arrays and slices in @sec-arrays.\n- How to import functionality from other Zig modules in @sec-root-file.\n\n\nBut, for now, this amount of knowledge is enough for us to continue with this book.\nLater, over the next chapters we will still talk more about other parts of\nZig's syntax that are also equally important. Such as:\n\n\n- How Object-Oriented programming can be done in Zig through *struct declarations* in @sec-structs-and-oop.\n- Basic control flow syntax in @sec-zig-control-flow.\n- Enums in @sec-enum;\n- Pointers and Optionals in @sec-pointer;\n- Error handling with `try` and `catch` in @sec-error-handling;\n- Unit tests in @sec-unittests;\n- Vectors in @sec-vectors-simd;\n- Build System in @sec-build-system;\n\n\n\n\n",
