Most of these functions and structs\ncomes from the `std.fs` module.\n\nWe are also going to talk about Input/Output (also known as IO) operations in Zig. Most of\nthese operations are made by using the structs and functions from `std.io` module, which defines\nfile descriptors for the *standard channels* of your system (`stdout` and `stdin`), and also,\nfunctions to create and use I/O streams.\n\n\n## Input/Output basics {#sec-io-basics}\n\nIf you have some experience in a high-level language, you have certainly used\nthese input and output functionalities before in this language. In other words, you certainly have\nbeen in a situation where you needed to sent some output to the user, or, to receive an input\nfrom the user.\n\nFor example, in Python we can receive some input from the user by using the `input()` built-in\nfunction. But we can also print (or \"show\") some output to the user by using the `print()`\nbuilt-in function. So yes, if you have programmed before in Python, you certainly have\nused these functions once before.\n\nBut do you know how these functions relate back to your operating system (OS)? How exactly\nthey are interacting with the resources of your OS to receive or sent some input/output.\nIn essence, these input/output functions from high-level languages are just abstractions\nover the *standard output* and *standard input* channels of your operating system.\n\nThis means that we receive an input, or send some output, through the operating system.\nIt's the OS that makes the bridge between the user and your program. Your program\ndoes not have a direct access to the user. It's the OS that intermediates every\nmessage exchanged between your program and the user.\n\nThe *standard output* and *standard input* channels of your OS are commonly known as the\n`stdout` and `stdin` channels of your OS, respectively. In some contexts, they are also\ncalled the *standard output device* and the *standard input device*. As the name suggests,\nthe *standard output* is the channel through which output flows, while the *standard input*\nis the channel in which input flows.\n\nFurthermore, OS's also normally create a dedicated channel for exchanging error messages, which is known as the\n*standard error* channel, or, the `stderr` channel. This is the channel to which error and warning messages\nare usually sent to. These are the messages that are normally displayed in red-like or orange-like colors\ninto your terminal.\n\nNormally, every OS (e.g. Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) creates a dedicated and separate set of\n*standard output*, *standard error* and *standard input* channels for every single program (or process) that runs in your computer.\nThis means that every program you write have a dedicated `stdin`, `stderr` and `stdout` that are separate\nfrom the `stdin`, `stderr` and `stdout` of other programs and processes that are currently running.\n\nThis is a behaviour from your OS. This does not come from the programming language that you are using.\nBecause as I sad earlier, input and output in programming languages, especially\nin high-level ones, are just a simple abstraction over the `stdin`, `stderr` and `stdout` from your current OS.\nThat is, your OS is the intermediary between every input/output operation made in your program,\nregardless of the programming language that you are using.\n\n\n### The writer and reader pattern {#sec-writer-reader}\n\nIn Zig, there is a pattern around input/output (IO). I (the author of this book) don't know if there\nis an official name for this pattern. But here, in this book, I will call it the \"writer and reader pattern\".\nIn essence, every IO operation in Zig is made through either a `Reader` or a `Writer` object[^gen-zig].\n\nThese two data types come from the `std.io` module of the Zig Standard Library. As their names suggests, a\n`Reader` is an object that offers tools to read data from \"something\" (or \"somewhere\"), while a `Writer`\noffers tools to write data into this \"something\". This \"something\" might be different things: like a\nfile that exists in your filesystem; or, it might be a network socket in your system[^sock]; or,\na continuous stream of data, like a standard input device from your system, that might be constantly\nreceiving new data from users, or, as another example, a live chat in a game that is constantly\nreceiving and displaying new messages from the players of the game.\n\n[^gen-zig]: Previously, these objects were known as the `GenericReader` and `GenericWriter` objects. But both of these types were deprecated in 0.15.\n[^sock]: The socket objects that we have created in @sec-create-socket, are examples of network sockets.\n\nSo, if you want to **read** data from something, or somewhere, it means that you need to use a `Reader` object.\nBut if you need instead, to **write** data into this \"something\", then, you need to use a `Writer` object instead.\nBoth of these objects are normally created from a file descriptor object. More specifically, through the `writer()` and `reader()`\nmethods of this file descriptor object. If you are not familiar with this type of object, go to the next section.\n\nEvery `Writer` object has methods like `print()`, which allows you to write/send a formatted string\n(i.e., this formatted string is like a `f` string in Python, or, similar to the `printf()` C function)\ninto the \"something\" (file, socket, stream, etc.) that you are using. It also has a `writeAll()` method, which allows you to\nwrite a string, or, an array of bytes into the \"something\".\n\nLikewise, every `Reader` object have methods like `readSliceAll()`, which allows you to read the\ndata from the \"something\" (file, socket, stream, etc.) until it fills a particular array (i.e., a \"buffer\") object.\nIn other words, if you provide an array object of 300 `u8` values to `readSliceAll()`, then, this method attempts to read 300 bytes\nof data from the \"something\", and it stores them into the array object that you have provided.\n\nAnother useful method is `takeDelimiterExclusive()`. In this method, you specify a \"delimiter character\".\nThe idea is that this function will attempt to read as many bytes of data as possible from the \"something\"\nuntil it finds the \"delimiter character\" that you have specified, and, it returns a slice with the data to you.\n\n\nThis is just a quick description of the methods present in these types of objects. But I recommend you\nto read the official docs, both for\n[`Writer`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.io.Writer)[^gen-write] and\n[`Reader`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.io.Reader)[^gen-read].\nI also think it's a good idea to read the source code of the modules in the Zig Standard Library\nthat defines the methods present in these objects, which are the\n[`Reader.zig`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/Io/Reader.zig)[^mod-read]\nand [`Writer.zig`](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/Io/Writer.zig)[^mod-write].\n\n[^gen-read]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.io.Reader>.\n[^gen-write]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.io.Writer>.\n[^mod-read]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/Io/Reader.zig>.\n[^mod-write]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/Io/Writer.zig>.\n\n\n\n### Introducing file descriptors {#sec-file-descriptor}\n\nA \"file descriptor\" object is a core component behind every IO operation that is made in any operating system (OS).\nSuch object is an identifier for a particular input/output (IO) resource from your OS [@wiki_file_descriptor].\nIt describes and identifies this particular resource. An IO resource might be:\n\n- an existing file in your filesystem.\n- an existing network socket.\n- other types of stream channels.\n- a pipeline (or just \"pipe\") in your terminal[^pipes].\n\n[^pipes]: A pipeline is a mechanism for inter-process communication, or, inter-process IO. You could also interpret a pipeline as a \"set of processes that are chained together, through the standard input/output devices of the system\". At Linux for example, a pipeline is created inside a terminal, by connecting two or more terminal commands with the \"pipe\" character (`|`).\n\nFrom the bullet points listed above, we know that although the term \"file\" is present,\na \"file descriptor\" might describe something more than just a file.\nThis concept of a \"file descriptor\" comes from the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) API,\nwhich is a set of standards that guide how operating systems across the world should be implemented,\nto maintain compatibility between them.\n\nA file descriptor not only identifies the input/output resource that you are using to receive or send some data,\nbut it also describes where this resource is, and also, which IO mode this resource is currently using.\nFor example, this IO resource might be using only the \"read\" IO mode, which means that this resource\nis open to \"read operations\", while \"write operations\" are not authorized.\nThese IO modes are essentially the modes that you provide to the argument `mode`\nfrom the `fopen()` C function, and also, from the `open()` Python built-in function.\n\nIn C, a \"file descriptor\" is a `FILE` pointer, but, in Zig, a file descriptor is a `File` object.\nThis data type (`File`) is described in the `std.fs` module of the Zig Standard Library.\nWe normally don't create a `File` object directly in our Zig code. Instead, we normally get such object as result when we\nopen an IO resource. In other words, we normally ask our OS to open a particular IO resource for us,\nand, if the OS do open successfully this IO resource, the OS normally handles back to us\na file descriptor to this particular IO resource.\n\nSo you usually get a `File` object by using functions and methods from the Zig Standard Library\nthat asks the OS to open some IO resource, like the `openFile()` method that opens a file in the\nfilesystem. The `net.Stream` object that we have created in @sec-create-socket is also a type of\nfile descriptor object.\n\n\n### The *standard output* {#sec-standard-output}\n\nYou already saw across this book, how can we access and use specifically the `stdout` in Zig\nto send some output to the user.\nFor that, we use the `File.stdout()` function from the `std.fs` module. This function returns\na file descriptor that describes the `stdout` channel of your current OS. Through this file\ndescriptor object, we can read from or write stuff to the `stdout` of our program.\n\nAlthough we can read stuff recorded into the `stdout` channel, we normally only\nwrite to (or \"print\") stuff into this channel. The reason is very similar to what we discussed at\n@sec-read-http-message, when we were discussing what \"reading from\" versus \"writing to\" the connection\nobject from our small HTTP Server project would mean.\n\nWhen we write stuff into a channel, we are essentially sending data to the other end of this channel.\nIn contrast, when we read stuff from this channel, we are essentially reading the data that was sent\nthrough this channel. Since the `stdout` is a channel to send output to the user, the key verb here\nis **send**. We want to send something to someone, and, as consequence, we want to **write** something\ninto some channel.\n\nThat is why, when we access `File.stdout()`, most of the times, we also use the `writer()` method from the `stdout` file descriptor,\nto get access to a writer object that we can use to write stuff into this `stdout` channel.\nAs we described in @sec-writer-reader, this `writer()` method returns a `Writer` object, and one of the\nmain methods of this `Writer` object is the `print()` method that we have used extensively across this book\nto write (or \"print\") a formatted string into the `stdout` channel.\n\nYou should also notice in the example below, that in order to instantiate this `Writer` object,\nwe must provide a reference to a buffer object as input to the `writer()` method. In the example below,\nthis buffer object is `stdout_buffer`. By providing such buffer, we transform the IO operations performed by\nthe `Writer` object into \"buffered IO operations\". We are going to talk more about \"buffered IO\" in @sec-buffered-io,\nso, don't worry too much about that for now.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    try stdout.writeAll(\n        \"This message was written into stdout.\\n\"\n    );\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis `Writer` object is like any other writer object that you would normally get from a file descriptor object.\nSo, the same methods from a writer object that you would use while writing files to the filesystem for example, you could also\nuse them here, from the file descriptor object of `stdout`, and vice-versa.\n\n\n### The *standard input*\n\nYou can access the *standard input* (i.e., `stdin`) in Zig by using the `File.stdin()` function from the `std.fs` module.\nLike its brother (`File.stdout()`), this function also returns a file descriptor object that describes the `stdin` channel\nof your OS.\n\nBecause we want to receive some input from the user, the key verb here becomes **receive**, and, as consequence,\nwe usually want to **read** data from the `stdin` channel, instead of writing data into it. So, we normally use\nthe `reader()` method of the file descriptor object returned by `File.stdin()`, to get access to a `Reader`\nobject that we can use to read data from `stdin`.\n\nIn the example below, we try to read the data from the `stdin` with the `takeDelimiterExclusive()` method\n(which will read all the data from the `stdin` until it hits a new line character - `'\\n'`, in the stream),\nand save this data into the `name` object.\n\nYou should also notice that, like we did with the `writer()` method, we also need to provide a reference to a buffer\nobject as input to the `reader()` method, when instantiating our `Reader` object. The reasons are exactly the same.\nThis input buffer transforms the IO operations performed by the `Reader` object into \"buffered IO operations\".\n\nIf you execute this program, you will notice that it stops the execution, ands start to wait indefinitely\nfor some input from the user. In other words, you need to type your name into the terminal, and then, you press Enter to\nsend your name to `stdin`. After you send your name to `stdin`, the program reads this input, and continues with the execution,\nby printing the given name to `stdout`. In the example below, I typed my name (Pedro) into the terminal, and then, pressed Enter.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\nvar stdin_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_buffer: [1024]u8 = undefined;\nvar stdout_writer = std.fs.File.stdout().writer(&stdout_buffer);\nvar stdin_reader = std.fs.File.stdin().reader(&stdin_buffer);\nconst stdin = &stdin_reader.interface;\nconst stdout = &stdout_writer.interface;\n\npub fn main() !void {\n    try stdout.writeAll(\"Type your name\\n\");\n    try stdout.flush();\n\n    const name = try stdin.takeDelimiterExclusive('\\n');\n\n    try stdout.print(\"Your name is: {s}\\n\", .{name});\n    try stdout.flush();\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nType your name\nYour name is: Pedro\n```\n\n\n### The *standard error*\n\nThe *standard error* (a.k.a. the `stderr`) works exactly the same as `stdout` and `stdin`.\nYou just call the `File.stderr()` function from the `std.fs` module, and you get the file descriptor to `stderr`.\nIdeally, you should write only error or warning messages to `stderr`, because this is\nthe purpose of this channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Buffered IO {#sec-buffered-io}\n\nAs we described in @sec-io-basics, input/output (IO) operations are made directly by the operating system.\nIt's the OS that manages the IO resource that you want to use for your IO operations.\nThe consequence of this fact is that IO operations are heavily based on system calls (i.e., calling the operating system directly).\n\nJust to be clear, there is nothing particularly wrong with system calls. We use them all the time on\nany serious codebase written in any low-level programming language. However, system calls are\nalways orders of magnitude slower than many different types of operations.\n\nSo is perfectly fine to use a system call once in a while. But when these system calls are used often,\nyou can clearly notice most of the time the loss of performance in your application. So, the good rule of thumb\nis to use a system call only when it's needed, and also, only in infrequent situations, to reduce\nthe number of system calls performed to a minimum.\n\n\n### Understanding how buffered IO works\n\nBuffered IO is a strategy to achieve better performance. It's used to reduce the number of system calls made by IO operations, and, as\nconsequence, achieve a much higher performance. In @fig-unbuffered-io and @fig-buffered-io you can find two different diagrams\nwhich presents the difference between read operations performed in an unbuffered IO environment versus a buffered IO environment.\n\nTo give a better context to these diagrams, let's suppose that we have a text file that contains the famous Lorem ipsum text[^lorem]\nin our filesystem. Let's also suppose that these diagrams in @fig-unbuffered-io and @fig-buffered-io\nare showing the read operations that we are performing to read the Lorem ipsum text from this text file.\nThe first thing you will notice when looking at these diagrams, is that in an unbuffered environment\nthe read operations leads to many system calls.\nMore precisely, in the diagram exposed in @fig-unbuffered-io we get one system call per each byte that we read from the text file.\nOn the other hand, in @fig-buffered-io we have only one system call at the very beginning.\n\nWhen we use a buffered IO system, at the first read operation we perform, instead of sending one single byte directly\nto our program, the OS first sends a chunk of bytes from the file to a buffer object (i.e., an array).\nThis chunk of bytes are cached/stored inside this buffer object.\n\nTherefore, from now on, for every new read operation that you perform, instead of making a new system call to ask\nfor the next byte in the file to the OS, this read operation is redirected to the buffer object, that have\nthis next byte already cached and ready to go.\n\n\n[^lorem]: <https://www.lipsum.com/>.\n\n\n![Unbuffered IO](./../Figures/unbuffered-io.png){#fig-unbuffered-io width=60%}\n\n![Buffered IO](./../Figures/buffered-io.png){#fig-buffered-io}\n\n\n\nThis is the basic logic behind buffered IO systems. The size of the buffer object depends on multiple factors. But it's usually\nequal to the size of a full page of memory (4096 bytes). If we follow this logic, then, the OS reads the first 4096 bytes\nof the file and caches it into the buffer object. As long as your program does not consume all of these 4096 bytes from the buffer,\nyou will not create new system calls.\n\nHowever, as soon as you consume all of these 4096 bytes from the buffer, it means that there is no bytes left in the buffer.\nIn this situation, a new system call is made to ask the OS to send the next 4096 bytes in the file, and once again,\nthese bytes are cached into the buffer object, and the cycle starts once again.\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIn general, you should always use a buffered IO reader or a buffered IO writer object in your code.\nBecause they deliver better performance to your IO operations.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Using buffered IO in Zig\n\nPreviously, IO operations in Zig were not buffered by default. However, since the new IO interface introduced in Zig 0.15,\nthe `Reader` and `Writer` interfaces take a buffer object as input when they are instantiated, like we demonstrated in @sec-standard-output.\nIn other words, a buffer object must be provided to instantiate a `Reader` or `Writer` object in your code. And because of that,\nwe have buffered IO operations by default on recent versions of Zig.\n\nIf you compare it with other languages, you will notice that Zig takes a slightly different approach in it's \"buffered IO strategy\". If we take C as an example, the IO operations made\nthrough a `FILE` pointer in C are buffered by default. However, in C, you don't need to explicitly pass a buffer object when instantiating such `FILE` pointer,\nbecause this buffer object is created behind the scenes for you, and therefore, it becomes invisible to the programmer. While in Zig, you must\nmanually create this buffer object yourself.\n\nSo, Zig not only choose to use buffered IO, but it also choose to give the programmer full control over the buffer used in such operations.\nYou (as the programmer) can directly control the size of this buffer, and you can also directly control how this specific buffer object\nis allocated in your code (i.e. you can either allocate it in the stack, or, use an `Allocator` object to allocate it in the heap),\nwhich fits very well with the \"no hidden allocations\" mantra of Zig.\n\nThus, if you want to use buffered IO in Zig, just make sure to pass a reference to a buffer object as input to either the `writer()` or `reader()`\nmethods to create a `Writer` or `Reader` object that performs buffered IO operations by default.\n\n\n### Don't forget to flush!\n\nWhen you use buffered IO operations in your code, is important to not forget to flush your buffers, specially on write operations.\nBasically, when we are in a buffered IO scenario, and we try to write data into \"something\", this data is first written into the IO buffer that we've provided\nto the `Writer` object as input, and this data in the IO buffer will only be effectively written into the \"something\" when we \"commit\" it.\nWe \"commit\" the bytes written into the IO buffer to our target output by \"flushing our IO buffer\".\n\nSo, when we flush our IO buffer, we are effectively commiting the chunk of data that is present in the IO buffer to\nbe written into the IO resource that is described by our file descriptor object. If we don't flush our IO buffer, then,\nthis data never leaves the IO buffer (i.e. it never reaches the IO resource). Therefore, when you forget to flush your IO\nresource, what happens, most of the times, is that you don't get any kind of output in your IO resource.\n\nFor example, if you are writing data into the `stdout`, and you forget to flush it, what usually happens is that you\ndon't get any kind of output written into the terminal. The program seems to run successfully, but you don't get any type of\nvisual output in the terminal to confirm it, and you get really frustrated and confused.\n\nThus, if you are writing data in Zig, don't forget to flush your IO buffers by calling the `flush()` method of your `Writer` object.\nThis will make sure that the bytes/data that you are writing are effectivelly written into the IO resource described by your file descriptor\nobject.\n\n::: {.callout-warn}\nIf you are writing data, do not forget to flush your IO buffer, by calling the `flush()` method of your `Writer` object.\n:::\n\n\n## Filesystem basics\n\nNow that we have discussed the basics around Input/Output operations in Zig, we need to\ntalk about the basics around filesystems, which is another core part of any operating system.\nAlso, filesystems are related to input/output, because the files that we store and create in our\ncomputer are considered an IO resource, as we described in @sec-file-descriptor.\n\n\n### The concept of current working directory (CWD)\n\nThe working directory is the folder on your computer where you are currently rooted at.\nIn other words, it's the folder that your program is currently looking at.\nTherefore, whenever you are executing a program, this program is always working with\na specific folder on your computer. It's always in this folder that the program will initially\nlook for the files you require, and it's also in this folder that the program\nwill initially save all the files you ask it to save.\n\nThe working directory is determined by the folder from which you invoke your program\nin the terminal. In other words, if you are in the terminal of your OS, and you\nexecute a binary file (i.e., a program) from this terminal, the folder to which your terminal\nis pointing at is the current working directory of your program that is being executed.\n\nIn @fig-cwd we have an example of me executing a program from the terminal. We are executing\nthe program outputted by the `zig` compiler by compiling the Zig module named `hello.zig`.\nThe CWD in this case is the `zig-book` folder. In other words, while the `hello.zig` program\nis executing, it will be looking at the `zig-book` folder, and any file operation that we perform\ninside this program, will be using this `zig-book` folder as the \"starting point\", or, as the \"central focus\".\n\n![Executing a program from the terminal](./../Figures/cwd.png){#fig-cwd}\n\nJust because we are rooted inside a particular folder (in the case of @fig-cwd, the `zig-book` folder) of our computer,\nit doesn't mean that we cannot access or write resources in other locations of our computer.\nThe current working directory (CWD) mechanism just defines where your program will look first\nfor the files you ask for. This does not prevent you from accessing files that are located\nelsewhere on your computer. However, to access any file that is in a folder other than your\ncurrent working directory, you must provide a path to that file or folder.\n\n\n### The concept of paths\n\nA path is essentially a location. It points to a location in your filesystem. We use\npaths to describe the location of files and folders in our computer.\nOne important aspect about paths is that they are always written inside strings,\ni.e., they are always provided as text values.\n\nThere are two types of paths that you can provide to any program in any OS: a relative path, or an absolute path.\nAbsolute paths are paths that start at the root of your filesystem, and go all the way to the file name or the specific folder\nthat you are referring to. This type of path is called absolute, because it points to an unique and absolute location on your computer.\nThat is, there is no other existing location on your computer that corresponds to this path. It's an unique identifier.\n\nIn Windows, an absolute path is a path that starts with a hard disk identifier (e.g. `C:/Users/pedro`).\nOn the other hand, absolute paths in Linux and macOS, are paths that start with a forward slash character (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).\nNotice that a path is composed by \"segments\". Each segment is connected to each other by a slash character (`\\` or `/`).\nOn Windows, the backward slash (`\\`) is normally used to connect the path segments. While on Linux and macOS, the forward\nslash (`/`) is the character used to connect path segments.\n\nA relative path is a path that start at the CWD. In other words, a relative path is\n\"relative to the CWD\". The path used to access the `hello.zig` file in @fig-cwd is an example of a relative path. This path\nis reproduced below. This path begins at the CWD, which in the context of @fig-cwd, is the `zig-book` folder,\nthen, it goes to the `ZigExamples` folder, then, into `zig-basics`, then, to the `hello.zig` file.\n\n```\nZigExamples/zig-basics/hello_world.zig\n```\n\n\n### Path wildcards\n\nWhen providing paths, especially relative paths, you have the option of using a *wildcard*.\nThere are two commonly used *wildcards* in paths, which are \"one period\" (.) and \"two periods\" (..).\nIn other words, these two specific characters have special meanings when used in paths,\nand can be used on any operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.). That is, they\nare \"cross platform\".\n\nThe \"one period\" represents an alias for the current directory.\nThis means that the relative paths `\"./Course/Data/covid.csv\"` and `\"Course/Data/covid.csv\"` are equivalent.\nOn the other hand, the \"two periods\" refers to the previous directory.\nFor example, the path `\"Course/..\"` is equivalent to the path `\".\"`, that is, the current working directory.\n\nTherefore, the path `\"Course/..\"` refers to the folder before the `Course` folder.\nAs another example, the path `\"src/writexml/../xml.cpp\"` refers to the file `xml.cpp`\nthat is inside the folder before the `writexml` folder, which in this example is the `src` folder.\nTherefore, this path is equivalent to `\"src/xml.cpp\"`.\n\n\n\n\n## The CWD handler\n\nIn Zig, filesystem operations are usually made through a directory handler object.\nA directory handler in Zig is an object of type `Dir`, which is an object that describes\na particular folder in the filesystem of our computer.\nYou normally create a `Dir` object, by calling the `std.fs.cwd()` function.\nThis function returns a `Dir` object that points to (or, that describes) the\ncurrent working directory (CWD).\n\nThrough this `Dir` object, you can create new files, or modify, or read existing ones that are\ninside your CWD. In other words, a `Dir` object is the main entrypoint in Zig to perform\nmultiple types of filesystem operations.\nIn the example below, we are creating this `Dir` object, and storing it\ninside the `cwd` object. Although we are not using this object at this code example,\nwe are going to use it a lot over the next examples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\n_ = cwd;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## File operations\n\n### Creating files {#sec-creating-files}\n\nWe create new files by using the `createFile()` method from the `Dir` object.\nJust provide the name of the file that you want to create, and this function will\ndo the necessary steps to create such file. You can also provide a relative path to this function,\nand it will create the file by following this path, which is relative to the CWD.\n\nThis function might return an error, so, you should use `try`, `catch`, or any of the other methods presented\nin @sec-error-handling to handle the possible error. But if everything goes well,\nthis `createFile()` method returns a file descriptor object (i.e., a `File` object) as result,\nthrough which you can add content to the file with the IO operations that I presented before.\n\nTake this code example below. In this example, we are creating a new text file\nnamed `foo.txt`. If the function `createFile()` succeeds, the object named `file` will contain a file descriptor\nobject, which we can use to write (or add) new content to the file, like we do in this example, by using\na buffered writer object to write a new line of text to the file.\n\nNow, a quick note, when we create a file descriptor object in C, by using a C function like `fopen()`, we must always close the file\nat the end of our program, or, as soon as we complete all operations that we wanted to perform\non the file. In Zig, this is no different. So everytime we create a new file, this file remains\n\"open\", waiting for some operation to be performed. As soon as we are done with it, we always have\nto close this file, to free the resources associated with it.\nIn Zig, we do this by calling the method `close()` from the file descriptor object.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\nconst file = try cwd.createFile(\"foo.txt\", .{});\n// Don't forget to close the file at the end.\ndefer file.close();\n// Do things with the file ...\nvar fw = file.writer();\n_ = try fw.writeAll(\n    \"Writing this line to the file\\n\"\n);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, in this example we not only have created a file into the filesystem,\nbut we also wrote some data into this file, using the file descriptor object\nreturned by `createFile()`. If the file that you are trying to create\nalready exists in your filesystem, this `createFile()` call will\noverwrite the contents of the file, or, in other words, it will\nin erase all the contents of the existing file.\n\nIf you don't want this to happen, meaning, that you don't want to overwrite\nthe contents of the existing file, but you want to write data to this file anyway\n(i.e., you want to append data to the file), you should use the `openFile()`\nmethod from the `Dir` object.\n\nAnother important aspect about `createFile()` is that this method creates a file\nthat is not open to read operations by default. It means that you cannot read this file.\nYou are not allowed to.\nSo for example, you might want to write some stuff into this file at the beginning of the execution\nof your program. Then, at a future point in your program you might need to read what you\nwrote in this file. If you try to read data from this file, you will likely\nget a `NotOpenForReading` error as result.\n\n\nBut how can you overcome this barrier? How can you create a file that is open\nto read operations? All you have to do, is to set the `read` flag to true\nin the second argument of `createFile()`. When you set this flag to true,\nthen the file gets create with \"read permissions\", and, as consequence,\na program like this one below becomes valid:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\nconst file = try cwd.createFile(\n    \"foo.txt\",\n    .{ .read = true }\n);\ndefer file.close();\n\nvar fw = file.writer();\n_ = try fw.writeAll(\"We are going to read this line\\n\");\n\nvar buffer: [300]u8 = undefined;\n@memset(buffer[0..], 0);\ntry file.seekTo(0);\nvar fr = file.reader();\n_ = try fr.readAll(buffer[0..]);\ntry stdout.print(\"{s}\\n\", .{buffer});\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n```\nWe are going to read this line\n```\n\n\nIf you are not familiar with position indicators, you might not recognize the method\n`seekTo()`. If that is your case, do not worry,\nwe are going to talk more about this method in @sec-indicators. But essentially\nthis method is moving the position indicator back to the beginning of the file,\nso that we can read the contents of the file from the beginning.\n\n\n### Opening files and appending data to it\n\nOpening files is easy. Just use the `openFile()` method instead of `createFile()`.\nIn the first argument of `openFile()` you provide the path to the file that\nyou want to open. Then, on the second argument you provide the flags (or, the options)\nthat dictates how the file is opened.\n\nYou can see the full list of options for `openFile()` by visiting the documentation for\n[`OpenFlags`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.File.OpenFlags)[^oflags].\nBut the main flag that you will most certainly use is the `mode` flag.\nThis flag specifies the IO mode that the file will be using when it gets opened.\nThere are three IO modes, or, three values that you can provide to this flag, which are:\n\n- `read_only`, allows only read operations on the file. All write operations are blocked.\n- `write_only`, allows only write operations on the file. All read operations are blocked.\n- `read_write`, allows both write and read operations on the file.\n\n[^oflags]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.File.OpenFlags>\n\nThese modes are similar to the modes that you provide to the `mode` argument of the\n`open()` Python built-in function[^py-open], or, the `mode` argument of the\n`fopen()` C function[^c-open].\nIn the code example below, we are opening the `foo.txt` text file with a `write_only` mode,\nand appending a new line of text to the end of the file. We use `seekFromEnd()` this time\nto guarantee that we are going to append the text to the end of the file. Once again, methods\nsuch as `seekFromEnd()` are described in more depth in @sec-indicators.\n\n[^py-open]: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files>\n[^c-open]: <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fopen.htm>\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\nconst file = try cwd.openFile(\n    \"foo.txt\", .{ .mode = .write_only }\n);\ndefer file.close();\ntry file.seekFromEnd(0);\nvar fw = file.writer();\n_ = try fw.writeAll(\"Some random text to write\\n\");\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Deleting files\n\nSometimes, we just need to delete/remove the files that we have.\nTo do that, we use the `deleteFile()` method. You just provide the path of the\nfile that you want to delete, and this method will try to delete the file located\nat this path.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\ntry cwd.deleteFile(\"foo.txt\");\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Copying files\n\nTo copy existing files, we use the `copyFile()` method. The first argument in this method\nis the path to the file that you want to copy. The second argument is a `Dir` object, i.e., a directory handler,\nmore specifically, a `Dir` object that points to the folder in your computer where you want to\ncopy the file to. The third argument is the new path of the file, or, in other words, the new location\nof the file. The fourth argument is the options (or flags) to be used in the copy operation.\n\nThe `Dir` object that you provide as input to this method will be used to copy the file to\nthe new location. You may create this `Dir` object before calling the `copyFile()` method.\nMaybe you are planning to copy the file to a completely different location in your computer,\nso it might be worth to create a directory handler to that location. But if you are copying the\nfile to a subfolder of your CWD, then, you can just simply pass the CWD handler to this argument.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\ntry cwd.copyFile(\n    \"foo.txt\",\n    cwd,\n    \"ZigExamples/file-io/foo.txt\",\n    .{}\n);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Read the docs!\n\nThere are some other useful methods for file operations available at `Dir` objects,\nsuch as the `writeFile()` method, but I recommend you to read the docs for the\n[`Dir` type](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.Dir)[^zig-dir]\nto explore the other available methods, since I already talked too much about them.\n\n\n[^zig-dir]: <https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.Dir>\n\n\n\n\n## Position indicators {#sec-indicators}\n\nA position indicator is like a type of cursor, or, an index. This \"index\" identifies the current\nlocation in the file (or, in the data stream) that the file descriptor object that you have\nis currently looking at.\nWhen you create a file descriptor, the position indicator starts at the beginning of the file,\nor, at the beginning of the stream. When you read from or write into the file (or socket, or data stream, etc.)\ndescribed by this file descriptor object, you end up moving the position indicator.\n\nIn other words, any IO operation have a common side effect, which is to move the position indicator.\nFor example, suppose that we have a file of 300 bytes total in size. If you\nread 100 bytes from the file, then, the position indicator moves 100 bytes forward. If you try\nto write 50 bytes into this same file, these 50 bytes will be written from the current\nposition indicated by the position indicator. Since the indicator is at a 100 bytes forward from\nthe beginning of the file, these 50 bytes would be written in the middle of the file.\n\nThis is why we have used the `seekTo()` method at the last code example presented in @sec-creating-files.\nWe have used this method to move the position indicator back to the beginning of the file, which\nwould make sure that we would write the text that we wanted to write from the beginning of the file,\ninstead of writing it from the middle of the file. Because before the write operation, we had\nperformed a read operation, which means that the position indicator was moved in this read operation.\n\nThe position indicators of a file descriptor object can be changed (or altered) by using the\n\"seek\" methods from this file descriptor, which are: `seekTo()`, `seekFromEnd()` and `seekBy()`.\nThese methods have the same effect, or, the same responsibility that the\n[`fseek()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fseek)[^c-fseek] C function.\n\n[^c-fseek]: <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fseek>\n\n\nConsidering that `offset` refers to the index that you provide as input to these \"seek\" methods,\nthe bullet points below summarises what is the effect of each of these methods.\nAs a quick note, in the case of `seekFromEnd()` and `seekBy()`, the `offset` provided can be either a\npositive or a negative index.\n\n- `seekTo()` will move the position indicator to the location that is `offset` bytes from the beginning of the file.\n- `seekFromEnd()` will move the position indicator to the location that is `offset` bytes from the end of the file.\n- `seekBy()` will move the position indicator to the location that is `offset` bytes from the current position in the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Directory operations\n\n### Iterating through the files in a directory\n\nOne of the most classic tasks related to filesystem is to be able\nto iterate through the existing files in a directory. To iterate over the\nfiles in a directory, we need to create an iterator object.\n\nYou can produce such iterator object by using either the `iterate()` or `walk()` methods\nof a `Dir` object. Both methods return an iterator object as output, which you can advance by using the\n`next()` method. The difference between these methods, is that `iterate()` returns a non-recursive iterator,\nwhile `walk()` does. It means that the iterator returned by `walk()` will not only iterate through\nthe files available in the current directory, but also, through the files from any subdirectory found\ninside the current directory.\n\nIn the example below, we are displaying the names of the files stored inside the\ndirectory `ZigExamples/file-io`. Notice that we had to open this directory through\nthe `openDir()` function. Also notice that we provided the flag `iterate` in the\nsecond argument of `openDir()`. This flag is important, because without this flag,\nwe would not be allowed to iterate through the files in this directory.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\nconst dir = try cwd.openDir(\n    \"ZigExamples/file-io/\",\n    .{ .iterate = true }\n);\nvar it = dir.iterate();\nwhile (try it.next()) |entry| {\n    try stdout.print(\n        \"File name: {s}\\n\",\n        .{entry.name}\n    );\n}\ntry stdout.flush();\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\nFile name: create_file_and_write_toit.zig\nFile name: create_file.zig\nFile name: lorem.txt\nFile name: iterate.zig\nFile name: delete_file.zig\nFile name: append_to_file.zig\nFile name: user_input.zig\nFile name: foo.txt\nFile name: create_file_and_read.zig\nFile name: buff_io.zig\nFile name: copy_file.zig\n```\n\n\n### Creating new directories\n\nThere are two methods that are important when it comes to\ncreating directories, which are `makeDir()` and `makePath()`.\nThe difference between these two methods is that `makeDir()` can\nonly create one single directory in the current directory in each call,\nwhile `makePath()` is capable of recursively create subdirectories in the same call.\n\n\nThis is why the name of this method is \"make path\". It will create as many\nsubdirectories as necessary to create the path that you provided as input.\nSo, if you provide the path `\"sub1/sub2/sub3\"` as input to this method,\nit will create three different subdirectories, `sub1`, `sub2` and `sub3`,\nwithin the same function call. In contrast, if you provided such path\nas input to `makeDir()`, you would likely get an error as result, since\nthis method can only create a single subdirectory.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\ntry cwd.makeDir(\"src\");\ntry cwd.makePath(\"src/decoders/jpg/\");\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Deleting directories\n\nTo delete a directory, just provide the path to the directory that you want to delete\nas input to the `deleteDir()` method from a `Dir` object. In the example below,\nwe are deleting the `src` directory that we have just created in the previous example.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.zig .cell-code}\nconst cwd = std.fs.cwd();\ntry cwd.deleteDir(\"src\");\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this chapter, I have described how to perform in Zig the most common filesystem and IO operations.\nBut you might feel the lack of some other, less common, operation in this chapter, such as: how to rename files,\nor how to open a directory, or how to create symbolic links, or how to use `access()` to test if a particular\npath exists in your computer. But for all of these less common tasks, I recommend you to read\nthe documentation of the [`Dir` type](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.fs.Dir)[^zig-dir]\n, since you can find a good description of these cases there.\n",
