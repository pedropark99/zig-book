# Contributing

First, you can contribute to this project by purchasing an eBook or a physical copy of this book on Amazon:

<https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJYMDRLP>

But you can also donate some amount directly to the author of the project via PayPal Donation:

These are good ways to support directly the author of the project, which helps to foster more contents like this, and it makes possible for the author to keep writing helpful tools and materials for the community.


But you can still contribute to this project in other ways. For example, these are some reasons why you could
[open new issues](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/issues)
on the official repository of the project:

- if you don't understand something, or, if a particular section of the book seems
  confusing to you, you can open an issue to clarify these points.
- to give a feedback, or, a suggestion of improvement.
- to point out an error in the book. This error can be:
    - a typo;
    - it might also be an error in the code examples (i.e. the code example doesn't work when it is supposed to work);
    - a knowledge error in the book, meaning that, there is a mistake in the technical explanation of a subject.

Now, maybe, you want to do something more than just open an issue. Maybe you want to actually
send a Pull Request to be reviewed. For example, if you spot a typo anywhere in the book,
feel free to edit the underlying QMD file
(QMD files are inside the [`Chapters` folder](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book/tree/main/Chapters))
of the current chapter to fix the typo, and send a Pull Request with the change.

If you've never done this before, the process is very easy:

- Click the edit this page on the sidebar.

- Make the changes using GitHub's in-page editor and save.

- Submit a pull request and include a brief description of your changes. "Fixing typos" is perfectly adequate.

If you send a Pull Request with significant changes, you need to include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution
to Pedro Duarte Faria" in the description of your Pull Request - I need this so I can publish the book.
