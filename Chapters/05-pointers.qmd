# Pointers and Optionals {#sec-pointer}

On our next project we are going to build a HTTP server from scratch.
But in order to do that, we need to learn more about pointers and how they work in Zig.
Pointers in Zig are similar to pointers in C. But they come with some extra advantages in Zig.

A pointer is an object that contains a memory address. This memory address is the address where
a particular value is stored in memory. It can be any value. Most of the times,
it is a value that comes from another object (or variable) present in our code.

In the example below, I'm creating two objects (`number` and `pointer`).
The `pointer` object contains the memory address where the value of the `number` object
(the number 5) is stored. So, that is a pointer in a nutshell. It is a memory
address that points to a particular existing value in the memory. You could
also say, that, the `pointer` object points to the memory address where the `number` object is
stored.


```{zig}
#| build_type: "run"
#| auto_main: true
const number: u8 = 5;
const pointer = &number;
_ = pointer;
```

We create a pointer object in Zig by using the `&` operator. When you put this operator
before the name of an existing object, you get the memory address of this object as result.
When you store this memory address inside a new object, this new object becomes a pointer object.
Because it stores a memory address.

People mostly use pointers as an alternative way to access a particular value.
For example, I can use the `pointer` object to access the value stored by
the `number` object. This operation of accessing the value that the
pointer "points to" is normally called of *dereferencing the pointer*.
We can dereference a pointer in Zig by using the `*` method of the pointer object. Like in the example
below, where we take the number 5 pointed by the `pointer` object,
and double it.

```{zig}
#| build_type: "run"
#| auto_main: true
const number: u8 = 5;
const pointer = &number;
const doubled = 2 * pointer.*;
std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{doubled});
```


This syntax to dereference the pointer is nice. Because we can easily chain it with
methods of the value pointed by the pointer. We can use the `User` struct that we 
created in @sec-structs-and-oop as an example. If you come back to that section,
you will see that this struct has a method named `print_name()`.

So, for example, if we have an user object, and a pointer that points to this user object,
we can use the pointer to access this user object, and, at the same time, call the method `print_name()`
on it, by chaining the dereference method (`*`) with the `print_name()` method. Like in the
example below:


```{zig}
#| eval: false
const u = User.init(1, "pedro", "email@gmail.com");
const pointer = &u;
try pointer.*.print_name();
```

```
pedro
```

We can also use pointers to effectively alter the value of an object.
For example, I could use the `pointer` object to set
the value of the object `number` to 6, like in the example below.


```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var number: u8 = 5;
const pointer = &number;
pointer.* = 6;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{number});
```


Therefore, as I mentioned earlier, people use pointers as an alternative way to access a particular value.
And they use it especially when they do not want to "move" these values around. There are situations where,
you want to access a particular value in a different scope (i.e. a different location) of your code,
but you do not want to "move" this value to this new scope (or location) that you are in.

This matters especially if this value is big in size. Because if it is, then,
moving this value becomes an expensive operation to do.
The computer will have to spend a considerable amount of time
copying this value to this new location.

Therefore, many programmers prefer to avoid this heavy operation of copying the value
to the new location, by accessing this value through pointers.
We are going to talk more about this "moving operation" over the next sections.
For now, just keep in mind that avoiding this "move operation" is
one of main reasons why pointers are used in programming languages.





## Constant objects vs variable objects {#sec-pointer-var}

You can have a pointer that points to a constant object, or, a pointer that points to a variable object.
But regardless of who this pointer is, a pointer **must always respect the characteristics of the object that it points to**.
As a consequence, if the pointer points to a constant object, then, you cannot use this pointer
to change the value that it points to. Because it points to a value that is constant. As we discussed in @sec-assignments, you cannot
change a value that is constant.

For example, if I have a `number` object, which is constant, I cannot execute
the expression below where I'm trying to change the value of `number` to 6 through
the `pointer` object. As demonstrated below, when you try to do something
like that, you get a compile time error:

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const number = 5;
const pointer = &number;
pointer.* = 6;
```

```
p.zig:6:12: error: cannot assign to constant
    pointer.* = 6;
```

If I change the `number` object to be a variable object, by introducing the `var` keyword,
then, I can successfully change the value of this object through a pointer, as demonstrated below:

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var number: u8 = 5;
const pointer = &number;
pointer.* = 6;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{number});
```

You can see this relationship between "constant versus variable" on the data type of
your pointer object. In other words, the data type of a pointer object already gives you
some clues about whether the value that it points to is constant or not.

When a pointer object points to a constant value, then, this pointer have a data type `*const T`,
which means "a pointer to a constant value of type `T`".
In contrast, if the pointer points to a variable value, then, the type of the pointer is usually `*T`, which is
simply "a pointer to a value of type `T`".
Hence, whenever you see a pointer object whose data type is in the format `*const T`, then,
you know that you cannot use this pointer to change the value that it points to.
Because this pointer points to a constant value of type `T`.


We have talked about the value pointed by the pointer being constant or not,
and the consequences that arises from it. But, what about the pointer object itself? I mean, what happens
if the pointer object itself is constant or not? Think about it.
We can have a constant pointer that points to a constant value.
But we can also have a variable pointer that points to a constant value. And vice-versa.

Until this point, the `pointer` object was always constant,
but what does this mean for us? What is the consequence of the
`pointer` object being constant? The consequence is that
we cannot change the pointer object, because it is constant. We can use the
pointer object in multiple ways, but we cannot change the
memory address that is inside this pointer object.

However, if we mark the `pointer` object as a variable object,
then, we can change the memory address pointed by this `pointer` object.
The example below demonstrates that. Notice that the object pointed
by the `pointer` object changes from `c1` to `c2`.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const c1: u8 = 5;
const c2: u8 = 6;
var pointer = &c1;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{pointer.*});
pointer = &c2;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{pointer.*});
```

```
5
6
```

Thus, by setting the `pointer` object to a `var` or `const` object,
you specify if the memory address contained in this pointer object can change or not
in your program. On the other side, you can change the value pointed by the pointer,
if, and only if this value is stored in a variable object. If this value
is in a constant object, then, you cannot change this value through a pointer.


## Types of pointer

In Zig, there are two types of pointers [@zigdocs], which are:

- single-item pointer (`*`);
- many-item pointer (`[*]`);


Single-item pointer objects are objects whose data types are in the format `*T`.
So, for example, if an object has the data type `*u32`, it means that this
object contains a single-item pointer that points to an unsigned 32-bit integer value.
As another example, if an object has type `*User`, then it contains
a single-item pointer to a `User` value.

In contrast, many-item pointers are objects whose data types are in the format `[*]T`.
Notice that the star symbol (`*`) is now inside a pair of brackets (`[]`). If the star
symbol is inside a pair of brackets, you know that this object is a many-item pointer.

When you apply the `&` operator over an object, you will always get a single-item pointer.
Many-item pointers are more of a "internal type" of the language, more closely
related to slices. So, when you deliberately create a pointer with the `&` operator,
you always get a single-item pointer as result.



## Pointer arithmetic

Pointer arithmetic is available in Zig, and they work the same way they work in C.
When you have a pointer that points to an array, the pointer usually points to
the first element in the array, and you can use pointer arithmetic to
advance this pointer and access the other elements in the array.


Notice in the example below, that initially, the `ptr` object was pointing
to the first element in the array `ar`. But then, I started to walk through the array, by advancing
the pointer with simple pointer arithmetic.

```{zig}
#| eval: true
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
#| results: "hide"
const ar = [_]i32{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
var ptr: [*]const i32 = &ar;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{ptr[0]});
ptr += 1;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{ptr[0]});
ptr += 1;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{ptr[0]});
```

```
1
2
3
```

Although you can create a pointer to an array like that, and
start to walk through this array by using pointer arithmetic,
in Zig, we prefer to use slices, which were presented in @sec-arrays.

Behind the hood, slices already are pointers,
and they also come with the `len` property, which indicates
how many elements are in the slice. This is good because the `zig` compiler
can use it to check for potential buffer overflows, and other problems like that.

Also, you don't need to use pointer arithmetic to walk through the elements
of a slice. You can simply use the `slice[index]` syntax to directly access
any element you want in the slice.
As I mentioned in @sec-arrays, you can get a slice from an array by using
a range selector inside brackets. In the example below, I'm creating
a slice (`sl`) that covers the entire `ar` array. I can access any
element of `ar` from this slice, and, the slice itself already is a pointer
behind the hood.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
const ar = [_]i32{1,2,3,4};
const sl = ar[0..ar.len];
_ = sl;
```


## Optionals and Optional Pointers

Let's talk about optionals and how they relate to pointers in Zig.
By default, objects in Zig are **non-nullable**. This means that, in Zig,
you can safely assume that any object in your source code is not null.

This is a powerful feature of Zig when you compare it to the developer experience in C.
Because in C, any object can be null at any point, and, as consequence, a pointer in C
might point to a null value. This is a common source of undefined behaviour in C.
When programmers work with pointers in C, they have to constantly check if
their pointers are pointing to null values or not.

If for some reason your Zig code produces a null value somewhere, and this null
value ends up in an object that is non-nullable, a runtime error is always
raised by your Zig program. Take the program below as an example.
The `zig` compiler can see the `null` value at compile time, and, as result,
it raises a compile time error. But, if a `null` value is raised during
runtime, a runtime error is also raised by the Zig program, with a
"attempt to use null value" message.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
var number: u8 = 5;
number = null;
```
```
p5.zig:5:14: error: expected type 'u8',
        found '@TypeOf(null)'
    number = null;
             ^~~~
```


You don't get this type of safety in C.
In C, you don't get warnings or errors about null values being produced in your program.
If for some reason your code produces a null value in C, most of the time you end up getting a segmentation fault error
as a result, which can mean many things.
That is why programmers have to constantly check for null values in C.

Pointers in Zig are also, by default, **non-nullable**. This is another amazing
feature in Zig. So, you can safely assume that any pointer that you create in
your Zig code is pointing to a non-null value.
Therefore, you don't have this heavy work of checking if the pointers you create
in Zig are pointing to a null value.


### What are optionals?

Ok, we know now that all objects are non-nullable by default in Zig.
But what if we actually need to use an object that might receive a null value?
Here is where optionals come in.

An optional object in Zig is an object that can be null.
To mark an object as optional, we use the `?` operator. When you put
this `?` operator right before the data type of an object, you transform
this data type into an optional data type, and the object becomes an optional object.

Take the snippet below as an example. We are creating a new variable object
called `num`. This object has the data type `?i32`, which means that,
this object contains either a signed 32-bit integer (`i32`), or, a null value.
Both alternatives are valid values to the `num` object.
That is why, I can actually change the value of this object to null, and,
no errors are raised by the `zig` compiler, as demonstrated below:

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var num: ?i32 = 5;
num = null;
```

### Optional pointers

You can also mark a pointer object as an optional pointer, meaning that,
this object contains either a null value, or, a pointer that points to a value.
When you mark a pointer as optional, the data type of this pointer object
becomes `?*const T` or `?*T`, depending if the value pointed by the pointer
is a constant value or not. The `?` identifies the object as optional, while
the `*` identifies it as a pointer object.

In the example below, we are creating a variable object named `num`, and an
optional pointer object named `ptr`. Notice that the data type of the object
`ptr` indicates that it is either a null value, or a pointer to an `i32` value.
Also, notice that the pointer object (`ptr`) can be marked as optional, even if
the object `num` is not optional.

What this code tells us is that, the `num` variable will never contain a null value.
This variable will always contain a valid `i32` value. But in contrast, the `ptr` object might contain either a null
value, or, a pointer to an `i32` value.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var num: i32 = 5;
var ptr: ?*i32 = &num;
ptr = null;
num = 6;
```

But what happens if we turn the table, and mark the `num` object as optional,
instead of the pointer object. If we do that, then, the pointer object is
not optional anymore. It would be a similar (although different) result. Because then, we would have
a pointer to an optional value. In other words, a pointer to a value that is either a
null value, or, a not-null value.

In the example below, we are recreating this idea. Now, the `ptr` object
has a data type of `*?i32`, instead of `?*i32`. Notice that the `*` symbol comes before of `?`
this time. So now, we have a pointer that points to a value that is either null
, or, a signed 32-bit integer.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var num: ?i32 = 5;
// ptr have type `*?i32`, instead of `?*i32`.
const ptr = &num;
_ = ptr;
```


### Null handling in optionals {#sec-null-handling}

When you have an optional object in your Zig code, you have to explicitly handle
the possibility of this object being null. It is like error-handling with `try` and `catch`.
In Zig, you also have to handle null values like if they were a type of error.

We can do that, by using either:

- an if statement, like you would do in C.
- the `orelse` keyword.
- unwrap the optional value with the `?` method.

When you use an if statement, you use a pair of pipes
to unwrap the optional value, and use this "unwrapped object"
inside the if block.
Using the example below as a reference, if the object `num` is null,
then, the code inside the if statement is not executed. Otherwise,
the if statement will unwrap the object `num` into the `not_null_num`
object. This `not_null_num` object is guaranteed to be not null inside
the scope of the if statement.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
const num: ?i32 = 5;
if (num) |not_null_num| {
    try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{not_null_num});
}
```

Now, the `orelse` keyword behaves like a binary operator. You connect two expressions with this keyword.
On the left side of `orelse`, you provide the expression that might result
in a null value, and on the right side of `orelse`, you provide another expression
that will not result in a null value.

The idea behind the `orelse` keyword is: if the expression on the left side
results in a not-null value, then this not-null value is used. However,
if this expression on the left side results in a null value, then the value
of the expression on the right side is used instead.

Looking at the example below, since the `x` object is currently null, the
`orelse` decided to use the alternative value, which is the number 15.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
const x: ?i32 = null;
const dbl = (x orelse 15) * 2;
try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{dbl});
```

You can use the if statement or the `orelse` keyword, when you want to
solve (or deal with) this null value. However, if there is no clear solution
to this null value, and the most logic and sane path is to simply panic
and raise a loud error in your program when this null value is encountered,
you can use the `?` method of your optional object.

In essence, when you use this `?` method, the optional object is unwrapped.
If a not-null value is found in the optional object, then, this not-null value is used.
Otherwise, the `unreachable` keyword is used. You can read more about this
[`unreacheable` keyword at the official documentation](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#unreachable)[^un-docs].
But in essence, when you build your Zig source code using the build modes `ReleaseSafe` or `Debug`, this
`unreacheable` keyword causes the program to panic and raise an error during runtime,
like in the example below:

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const std = @import("std");
const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
fn return_null(n: i32) ?i32 {
    if (n == 5) return null;
    return n;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    const x: i32 = 5;
    const y: ?i32 = return_null(x);
    try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{y.?});
}
```

```
thread 12767 panic: attempt to use null value
p7.zig:12:34: 0x103419d in main (p7):
    try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{y.?});
                                 ^
```
