# Structs, Modules and Control Flow

I introduced a lot of the Zig's syntax to you in the last chapter,
specially at @sec-root-file and @sec-main-file.
But we still need to discuss about some other very important
elements of the language that you will use constantly on your day-to-day
routine.

We begin this chapter by talking about the different keywords and structures
in Zig related to control flow (e.g. loops and if statements).
Then, we talk about structs and how they can be used to do some
basic Object-Oriented (OOP) patterns in Zig. We also talk about
type inference, which help us to write less code and achieve the same results.
Finally, we end this chapter by discussing modules, and how they relate
to structs.



## Control flow {#sec-zig-control-flow}

Sometimes, you need to make decisions in your program. Maybe you need to decide
wether to execute or not a specific piece of code. Or maybe,
you need to apply the same operation over a sequence of values. These kinds of tasks,
involve using structures that are capable of changing the "control flow" of our program.

In computer science, the term "control flow" usually refers to the order in which expressions (or commands)
are evaluated in a given language or program. But this term is also used to refer
to structures that are capable of changing this "evaluation order" of the commands
executed by a given language/program.

These structures are better known
by a set of terms, such as: loops, if/else statements, switch statements, among others. So,
loops and if/else statements are examples of structures that can change the "control
flow" of our program. The keywords `continue` and `break` are also examples of symbols
that can change the order of evaluation, since they can move our program to the next iteration
of a loop, or make the loop stop completely.


### If/else statements

An if/else statement performs an "conditional flow operation".
A conditional flow control (or choice control) allows you to execute
or ignore a certain block of commands based on a logical condition.
Many programmers and computer science professionals also use
the term "branching" in this case.
In essence, we use if/else statements to use the result of a logical test
to decide whether or not to execute a given block of commands.

In Zig, we write if/else statements by using the keywords `if` and `else`.
We start with the `if` keyword followed by a logical test inside a pair
of parentheses, and then, a pair of curly braces with contains the lines
of code to be executed in case the logical test returns the value `true`.

After that, you can optionally add an `else` statement. Just add the `else`
keyword followed by a pair of curly braces, with the lines of code
to executed in case the logical test defined in the `if`
returns `false`.

In the example below, we are testing if the object `x` contains a number
that is greater than 10. Judging by the output printed to the console,
we know that this logical test returned `false`. Because the output
in the console is compatible with the line of code present in the
`else` branch of the if/else statement.


```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
const x = 5;
if (x > 10) {
    try stdout.print(
        "x > 10!\n", .{}
    );
} else {
    try stdout.print(
        "x <= 10!\n", .{}
    );
}
```



### Switch statements {#sec-switch}

Switch statements are also available in Zig.
A switch statement in Zig have a similar syntax to a switch statement in Rust.
As you would expect, to write a switch statement in Zig we use the `switch` keyword.
We provide the value that we want to "switch over" inside a
pair of parentheses. Then, we list the possible combinations (or "branchs")
inside a pair of curly braces.

Let's take a look at the code example below. You can see in this example that,
I'm creating an enum type called `Role`. We talk more about enums at @sec-enum.
But in essence, this `Role` type is listing different types of roles in a fictitious
company, like `SE` for Software Engineer, `DE` for Data Engineer, `PM` for Product Manager,
etc.

Notice that we are using the value from the `role` object in the
switch statement, to discover which exact area we need to store in the `area` variable object.
Also notice that we are using type inference inside the switch statement, with the dot character,
as we described at @sec-type-inference.
This makes the `zig` compiler infer the correct data type of the values (`PM`, `SE`, etc.) for us.

Also notice that, we are grouping multiple values in the same branch of the switch statement.
We just separate each possible value with a comma. So, for example, if `role` contains either `DE` or `DA`,
the `area` variable would contain the value `"Data & Analytics"`, instead of `"Platform"`.

```{zig}
#| build_type: "run"
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
const Role = enum {
    SE, DPE, DE, DA, PM, PO, KS
};

pub fn main() !void {
    var area: []const u8 = undefined;
    const role = Role.SE;
    switch (role) {
        .PM, .SE, .DPE, .PO => {
            area = "Platform";
        },
        .DE, .DA => {
            area = "Data & Analytics";
        },
        .KS => {
            area = "Sales";
        },
    }
    try stdout.print("{s}\n", .{area});
}
```


#### Switch statements must exhaust all possibilities

Now, one very important aspect about this switch statement presented
in the code example above, is that it exhaust all existing possibilities.
In other words, all possible values that could be found inside the `order`
object are explicitly handled in this switch statement.

Since the `role` object have type `Role`, the only possible values to
be found inside this object are `PM`, `SE`, `DPE`, `PO`, `DE`, `DA` and `KS`.
There is no other possible value to be stored in this `role` object.
This what "exhaust all existing possibilities" means. The switch statement covers
every possible case.

In Zig, switch statements must exhaust all existing possibilities. You cannot write
a switch statement, and leave an edge case with no expliciting action to be taken.
This is a similar behaviour to switch statements in Rust, which also have to
handle all possible cases.



#### The else branch

Take a look at the `dump_hex_fallible()` function below as an example. This function
also comes from the Zig Standard Library, but this time, it comes from the
[`debug.zig` module](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/debug.zig)[^debug-mod].
There are multiple lines in this function, but I omitted them to focus solely on the
switch statement found in this function. Notice that this switch statement have four
possible cases, or four explicit branches. Also, notice that we used an `else` branch
in this case. Whenever you have multiple cases in your switch statement
which you want to apply the same exact action, you can use an `else` branch to do that.

[^debug-mod]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/debug.zig>

```{zig}
#| eval: false
pub fn dump_hex_fallible(bytes: []const u8) !void {
    // Many lines ...
    switch (byte) {
        '\n' => try writer.writeAll("␊"),
        '\r' => try writer.writeAll("␍"),
        '\t' => try writer.writeAll("␉"),
        else => try writer.writeByte('.'),
    }
}
```

Many users would also use an `else` branch to handle a "not supported" case.
That is, a case that cannot be properly handled by your code, or, just a case that
should not be "fixed". So many programmers use an `else` branch to panic (or raise an error) to stop
the current execution.

Take the code example below as an example. We can see that, we are handling the cases
for the `level` object being either 1, 2, or 3. All other possible cases are not supported by default,
and, as consequence, we raise an runtime error in these cases, through the `@panic()` built-in function.

Also notice that, we are assigning the result of the switch statement to a new object called `category`.
This is another thing that you can do with switch statements in Zig. If the branchs in this switch
statement output some value as result, you can store the result value of the switch statement into
a new object.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const level: u8 = 4;
const category = switch (level) {
    1, 2 => "beginner",
    3 => "professional",
    else => {
        @panic("Not supported level!");
    },
};
try stdout.print("{s}\n", .{category});
```

```
thread 13103 panic: Not supported level!
t.zig:9:13: 0x1033c58 in main (switch2)
            @panic("Not supported level!");
            ^
```



#### Using ranges in switch

Furthermore, you can also use ranges of values in switch statements.
That is, you can create a branch in your switch statement that is used
whenever the input value is contained in a range. These range
expressions are created with the operator `...`. Is important
to emphasize that the ranges created by this operator are
inclusive on both ends.

For example, I could easily change the previous code example to support all
levels between 0 and 100. Like this:

```{zig}
#| build_type: "run"
#| auto_main: true
const level: u8 = 4;
const category = switch (level) {
    0...25 => "beginner",
    26...75 => "intermediary",
    76...100 => "professional",
    else => {
        @panic("Not supported level!");
    },
};
try stdout.print("{s}\n", .{category});
```

This is neat, and it works with character ranges too. That is, I could
simply write `'a'...'z'`, to match any character value that is a
lowercase letter, and it would work fine.


#### Labeled switch statements

At @sec-blocks we have talked about labeling blocks, and also, about using these labels
to return a value from the block. Well, from version 0.14.0 and onwards of the `zig` compiler,
you can also apply labels over switch statements,
which makes possible to implement almost a "C goto like" pattern in Zig.

For example, if you give the label `xsw` to a switch statement, you can use this
label in conjunction with the `continue` keyword to go back to the beginning of the switch
statement. In the example below, the execution goes back to the beginning of the
switch statement two times, before ending at the `3` branch.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "lib"
#| eval: false
xsw: switch (@as(u8, 1)) {
    1 => continue :xsw 2,
    2 => continue :xsw 3,
    3 => return,
    4 => {},
}
```


### The `defer` keyword {#sec-defer}

With the `defer` keyword you can execute expressions at the end of the current scope.
Take the `foo()` function below as an example. When we execute this function, the expression
that prints the message "Exiting function ..." get's executed only at
the end of the function scope.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "run"
#| echo: true
#| results: "hide"
const std = @import("std");
const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
fn foo() !void {
    defer std.debug.print(
        "Exiting function ...\n", .{}
    );
    try stdout.print("Adding some numbers ...\n", .{});
    const x = 2 + 2; _ = x;
    try stdout.print("Multiplying ...\n", .{});
    const y = 2 * 8; _ = y;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    try foo();
}
```

```
Adding some numbers ...
Multiplying ...
Exiting function ...
```

It doesn't matter how the function exits (i.e. because
of an error, or, because of an return statement, or whatever),
just remember, this expression get's executed when the function exits.




### For loops

A loop allows you to execute the same lines of code multiple times,
thus, creating a "repetition space" in the execution flow of your program.
Loops are particularly useful when we want to replicate the same function
(or the same set of commands) over several different inputs.

There are different types of loops available in Zig. But the most
essential of them all is probably the *for loop*. A for loop is
used to apply the same piece of code over the elements of a slice or an array.

For loops in Zig have a slightly different syntax that you are
probably used to see in other languages. You start with the `for` keyword, then, you
list the items that you want to iterate
over inside a pair of parentheses. Then, inside of a pair of pipes (`|`)
you should declare an identifier that will serve as your iterator, or,
the "repetition index of the loop".

```{zig}
#| eval: false
for (items) |value| {
    // code to execute
}
```

Instead of using a `(value in items)` syntax,
in Zig, for loops use the syntax `(items) |value|`. In the example
below, you can see that we are looping through the items
of the array stored at the object `name`, and printing to the
console the decimal representation of each character in this array.

If we wanted, we could also iterate through a slice (or a portion) of
the array, instead of iterating through the entire array stored in the `name` object.
Just use a range selector to select the section you want. For example,
I could provide the expression `name[0..3]` to the for loop, to iterate
just through the first 3 elements in the array.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
const name = [_]u8{'P','e','d','r','o'};
for (name) |char| {
    try stdout.print("{d} | ", .{char});
}
```

In the above example we are using the value itself of each
element in the array as our iterator. But there are many situations where
we need to use an index instead of the actual values of the items.

You can do that by providing a second set of items to iterate over.
More precisely, you provide the range selector `0..` to the for loop. So,
yes, you can use two different iterators at the same time in a for
loop in Zig.

But remember from @sec-assignments that, every object
you create in Zig must be used in some way. So if you declare two iterators
in your for loop, you must use both iterators inside the for loop body.
But if you want to use just the index iterator, and not use the "value iterator",
then, you can discard the value iterator by maching the
value items to the underscore character, like in the example below:


```{zig}
#| eval: false
for (name, 0..) |_, i| {
    try stdout.print("{d} | ", .{i});
}
```

```
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
```


### While loops

A while loop is created from the `while` keyword. A `for` loop
iterates through the items of an array, but a `while` loop
will loop continuously, and infinitely, until a logical test
(specified by you) becomes false.

You start with the `while` keyword, then, you define a logical
expression inside a pair of parentheses, and the body of the
loop is provided inside a pair of curly braces, like in the example below:

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var i: u8 = 1;
while (i < 5) {
    try stdout.print("{d} | ", .{i});
    i += 1;
}
```



### Using `break` and `continue`

In Zig, you can explicitly stop the execution of a loop, or, jump to the next iteration of the loop, using
the keywords `break` and `continue`, respectively. The `while` loop present in the example below, is
at first sight, an infinite loop. Because the logical value inside the parenthese will always be equal to `true`.
What makes this `while` loop stop when the `i` object reaches the count
10? Is the `break` keyword!

Inside the while loop, we have an if statement that is constantly checking if the `i` variable
is equal to 10. Since we are increasing the value of this `i` variable at each iteration of the
while loop. At some point, this `i` variable will be equal to 10, and when it does, the if statement
will execute the `break` expression, and, as a result, the execution of the while loop is stopped.

Notice the `expect()` function from the Zig standard library after the while loop.
This `expect()` function is an "assert" type of function.
This function checks if the logical test provided is equal to true. If this logical test is false,
the function raises an assertion error. But it is equal to true, then, the function will do nothing.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
var i: usize = 0;
while (true) {
    if (i == 10) {
        break;
    }
    i += 1;
}
try std.testing.expect(i == 10);
try stdout.print("Everything worked!", .{});
```

Since this code example was executed succesfully by the `zig` compiler,
without raising any errors, then, we known that, after the execution of while loop,
the `i` variable is equal to 10. Because if it wasn't equal to 10, then, an error would
be raised by `expect()`.

Now, in the next example, we have an use case for
the `continue` keyword. The if statement is constantly
checking if the current index is a multiple of 2. If
it is, then we jump to the next iteration of the loop
directly. But it the current index is not a multiple of 2,
then, the loop will simply print this index to the console.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: true
#| build_type: "run"
const ns = [_]u8{1,2,3,4,5,6};
for (ns) |i| {
    if ((i % 2) == 0) {
        continue;
    }
    try stdout.print("{d} | ", .{i});
}
```



## Function parameters are immutable {#sec-fun-pars}

We have already discussed a lot of the syntax behind function declarations at @sec-root-file and @sec-main-file.
But I want to emphasize a curious fact about function parameters (a.k.a. function arguments) in Zig.
In summary, function parameters are immutable in Zig.

Take the code example below, where we declare a simple function that just tries to add
some amount to the input integer, and returns the result back. But if you look closely
at the body of this `add2()` function, you will notice that we try
to save the result back into the `x` function argument.

In other words, this function not only use the value that it received through the function argument
`x`, but it also tries to change the value of this function argument, by assigning the addition result
into `x`. However, function arguments in Zig are immutable. You cannot change their values, or, you
cannot assign values to them inside the body's function.

This is the reason why, the code example below do not compile successfully. If you try to compile
this code example, you get a compile error warning you that you are trying to change the value of a
immutable (i.e. constant) object.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const std = @import("std");
fn add2(x: u32) u32 {
    x = x + 2;
    return x;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    const y = add2(4);
    std.debug.print("{d}\n", .{y});
}
```

```
t.zig:3:5: error: cannot assign to constant
    x = x + 2;
    ^
```


If a function argument receives as input a object whose data type is
any of the primitive types that we have listed at @sec-primitive-data-types
this object is always passed by value to the function. In other words, this object
is copied to the function stack frame.

However, if the input object have a more complex data type, for example, it might
be a struct instance, or an array, or a union, etc., in cases like that, the `zig` compiler
will take the liberty of deciding for you which strategy is best. The `zig` compiler will
pass your object to the function either by value, or by reference. The compiler will always
choose the strategy that is faster for you.
This optimization that you get for free is possible only because function arguments are
immutable in Zig.

To overcome this barrier, we need to take the lead, and explicitly choose to pass the
object by reference. That is, instead of depending on the `zig` compiler to decide for us, we need
to explicitly mark the function argument as a pointer. This way, we are telling the compiler
that this function argument will be passed by reference to the function.

By making it a pointer, we can finally use and alter directly the value of this function argument inside
the body of the `add2()` function. You can see that the code example below compiles successfully.

```{zig}
#| build_type: "run"
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
fn add2(x: *u32) void {
    const d: u32 = 2;
    x.* = x.* + d;
}

pub fn main() !void {
    var x: u32 = 4;
    add2(&x);
    std.debug.print("Result: {d}\n", .{x});
}
```

```
Result: 6
```



## Structs and OOP {#sec-structs-and-oop}

Zig is a language more closely related to C (which is a procedural language),
than it is to C++ or Java (which are object-oriented languages). Because of that, you do not
have advanced OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) patterns available in Zig, such as classes, interfaces or
class inheritance. Nonetheless, OOP in Zig is still possible by using struct definitions.

With struct definitions, you can create (or define) a new data type in Zig. These struct definitions work the same way as they work in C.
You give a name to this new struct (or, to this new data type you are creating), then, you list the data members of this new struct. You can
also register functions inside this struct, and they become the methods of this particular struct (or data type), so that, every object
that you create with this new type, will always have these methods available and associated with them.

In C++, when we create a new class, we normally have a constructor method (or, a constructor function) to construct or to instantiate every object
of this particular class, and you also have a destructor method (or a destructor function) that
is the function responsible for destroying every object of this class.

In Zig, we normally declare the constructor and the destructor methods
of our structs, by declaring an `init()` and a `deinit()` methods inside the struct.
This is just a naming convention that you will find across the entire Zig standard library.
So, in Zig, the `init()` method of a struct is normally the constructor method of the class represented by this struct.
While the `deinit()` method is the method used for destroying an existing instance of that struct.

The `init()` and `deinit()` methods are both used extensively in Zig code, and you will see both of
them being used when we talk about allocators at @sec-allocators.
But, as another example, let's build a simple `User` struct to represent an user of some sort of system.
If you look at the `User` struct below, you can see the `struct` keyword, and inside of a
pair of curly braces, we write the struct's body.

Notice the data members of this struct, `id`, `name` and `email`. Every data member have it's
type explicitly annotated, with the colon character (`:`) syntax that we described earlier at @sec-root-file.
But also notice that every line in the struct body that describes a data member, ends with a comma character (`,`).
So every time you declare a data member in your Zig code, always end the line with a comma character, instead
of ending it with the traditional semicolon character (`;`).

Next, also notice in this example, that we registrated an `init()` function as a method
of this `User` struct. This `init()` method is the constructor method that you use to instantiate
every new `User` object. That is why this `init()` function return an `User` object as result.


```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "run"
const std = @import("std");
const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
const User = struct {
    id: u64,
    name: []const u8,
    email: []const u8,

    pub fn init(id: u64,
                name: []const u8,
                email: []const u8) User {

        return User {
            .id = id,
            .name = name,
            .email = email
        };
    }

    pub fn print_name(self: User) !void {
        try stdout.print("{s}\n", .{self.name});
    }
};

pub fn main() !void {
    const u = User.init(1, "pedro", "email@gmail.com");
    try u.print_name();
}
```

The `pub` keyword plays an important role in struct declarations, and OOP in Zig.
Every method that you declare in your struct that is marked with the keyword `pub`,
becomes a public method of this particular struct.

So every method that you create in your struct, is, at first, a private method
of that struct. Meaning that, this method can only be called from within this
struct. But, if you mark this method as public, with the keyword `pub`, then,
you can call the method directly from the `User` object you have
in your code.

In other words, the functions marked by the keyword `pub`
are members of the public API of that struct.
For example, if I did not marked the `print_name()` method as public,
then, I could not execute the line `u.print_name()`. Because I would
not be authorized to call this method directly in my code.



### Anonymous struct literals {#sec-anonymous-struct-literals}

You can declare a struct object as a literal value. When we do that, we normally specify the
data type of this struct literal by writing it's data type just before the opening curly braces.
For example, I could write a struct literal of type `User` that we defined in the previous section like
this:

```{zig}
#| eval: false
const eu = User {
    .id = 1,
    .name = "Pedro",
    .email = "someemail@gmail.com"
};
_ = eu;
```

However, in Zig, we can also write an anonymous struct literal. That is, you can write a
struct literal, but not especify explicitly the type of this particular struct.
An anonymous struct is written by using the syntax `.{}`. So, we essentially
replaced the explicit type of the struct literal with a dot character (`.`).

As we described at @sec-type-inference, when you put a dot before a struct literal,
the type of this struct literal is automatically inferred by the `zig` compiler.
In essence, the `zig` compiler will look for some hint of what is the type of that struct.
It can be the type annotation of an function argument,
or the return type annotation of the function that you are using, or the type annotation
of a variable.
If the compiler do find such type annotation, then, it will use this
type in your literal struct. 

Anonymous structs are very commom to use in function arguments in Zig.
One example that you have seen already constantly, is the `print()`
function from the `stdout` object.
This function takes two arguments.
The first argument, is a template string, which should
contain string format specifiers in it, which tells how the values provided
in the second argument should be printed into the message.

While the second argument is a struct literal that lists the values
to be printed into the template message specified in the first argument.
You normally want to use an anonymous struct literal here, so that, the
`zig` compiler do the job of specifying the type of this particular
anonymous struct for you.

```{zig}
#| build_type: "run"
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
pub fn main() !void {
    const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
    try stdout.print("Hello, {s}!\n", .{"world"});
}
```



### Struct declarations must be constant

Types in Zig must be `const` or `comptime` (we are going to talk more about comptime at @sec-comptime).
What this means is that you cannot create a new data type, and mark it as variable with the `var` keyword.
So struct declarations are always constant. You cannot declare a new struct using the `var` keyword.
It must be `const`.

In the `Vec3` example below, this declaration is allowed because I'm using the `const` keyword
to declare this new data type.

```{zig}
#| build_type: "lib"
#| auto_main: false
const Vec3 = struct {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    z: f64,
};
```


### The `self` method argument {#sec-self-arg}

In every language that have OOP, when we declare a method of some class or struct, we
usually declare this method as a function that have a `self` argument.
This `self` argument is the reference to the object itself from which the method
is being called from.

Is not mandatory to use this `self` argument. But why would you not use this `self` argument?
There is no reason to not use it. Because the only way to get access to the data stored in the
data members of your struct is to access them through this `self` argument.
If you don't need to use the data in the data members of your struct inside your method, then, you very likely don't need
a method, you can just simply declare this logic as a simple function, outside of your
struct declaration.


Take the `Vec3` struct below. Inside this `Vec3` struct we declared a method named `distance()`.
This method calculates the distance between two `Vec3` objects, by following the distance
formula in euclidean space. Notice that this `distance()` method takes two `Vec3` objects
as input, `self` and `other`.


```{zig}
#| build_type: "lib"
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
const m = std.math;
const Vec3 = struct {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    z: f64,

    pub fn distance(self: Vec3, other: Vec3) f64 {
        const xd = m.pow(f64, self.x - other.x, 2.0);
        const yd = m.pow(f64, self.y - other.y, 2.0);
        const zd = m.pow(f64, self.z - other.z, 2.0);
        return m.sqrt(xd + yd + zd);
    }
};
```


The `self` argument corresponds to the `Vec3` object from which this `distance()` method
is being called from. While the `other` is a separate `Vec3` object that is given as input
to this method. In the example below, the `self` argument corresponds to the object
`v1`, because the `distance()` method is being called from the `v1` object,
while the `other` argument corresponds to the object `v2`.


```{zig}
#| eval: false
const v1 = Vec3 {
    .x = 4.2, .y = 2.4, .z = 0.9
};
const v2 = Vec3 {
    .x = 5.1, .y = 5.6, .z = 1.6
};

std.debug.print(
    "Distance: {d}\n",
    .{v1.distance(v2)}
);
```

```
Distance: 3.3970575502926055
```



### About the struct state

Sometimes you don't need to care about the state of your struct object. Sometimes, you just need
to instantiate and use the objects, without altering their state. You can notice that when you have methods
inside your struct declaration that might use the values that are present in the data members, but they
do not alter the values in the data members of the struct in anyway.

The `Vec3` struct that was presented at @sec-self-arg is an example of that.
This struct have a single method named `distance()`, and this method do use the values
present in all three data members of the struct (`x`, `y` and `z`). But at the same time,
this method do not change the values of these data members in any point.

As a result of that, when we create `Vec3` objects we usually create them as
constant objects, like the `v1` and `v2` objects presented at @sec-self-arg.
We can create them as variable objects with the `var` keyword,
if we want to. But because the methods of this `Vec3` struct do not change
the state of the objects in any point, is unnecessary to mark them
as variable objects.

But why? Why am I talkin about this here? Is because the `self` argument
in the methods is affected depending on whether the
methods present in a struct change or not the state of the object itself.
More specifically, when you have a method in a struct that changes the state
of the object (i.e. change the value of a data member), the `self` argument
in this method must be annotated in a different manner.

As I described at @sec-self-arg, the `self` argument in methods of
a struct is the argument that receives as input the object from which the method
was called from. We usually annotate this argument in the methods by writing `self`,
followed by the colon character (`:`), and the data type of the struct to which
the method belongs to (e.g. `User`, `Vec3`, etc.).

If we take the `Vec3` struct that we defined in the previous section as an example,
we can see in the `distance()` method that this `self` argument is annotated as
`self: Vec3`. Because the state of the `Vec3` object is never altered by this
method.

But what if we do have a method that alters the state of the object, by altering the
values of it's data members. How should we annotate `self` in this instance? The answer is:
"we should annotate `self` as a pointer of `x`, instead of just `x`".
In other words, you should annotate `self` as `self: *x`, instead of annotating it
as `self: x`.

If we create a new method inside the `Vec3` object that, for example, expands the
vector by multiplying it's coordinates by a factor o two, then, we need to follow
this rule specified in the previous paragraph. The code example below demonstrates
this idea:

```{zig}
#| build_type: "lib"
#| auto_main: false
const std = @import("std");
const m = std.math;
const Vec3 = struct {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
    z: f64,

    pub fn distance(self: Vec3, other: Vec3) f64 {
        const xd = m.pow(f64, self.x - other.x, 2.0);
        const yd = m.pow(f64, self.y - other.y, 2.0);
        const zd = m.pow(f64, self.z - other.z, 2.0);
        return m.sqrt(xd + yd + zd);
    }

    pub fn double(self: *Vec3) void {
        self.x = self.x * 2.0;
        self.y = self.y * 2.0;
        self.z = self.z * 2.0;
    }
};
```

Notice in the code example above that we have added a new method
to our `Vec3` struct named `double()`. This method essentially doubles the
coordinate values of our vector object. Also notice that, in the
case of the `double()` method, we annotated the `self` argument as `*Vec3`,
indicating that this argument receives a pointer (or a reference, if you prefer to call it this way)
to a `Vec3` object as input.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
var v3 = Vec3 {
    .x = 4.2, .y = 2.4, .z = 0.9
};
v3.double();
std.debug.print("Doubled: {d}\n", .{v3.x});
```

```
Doubled: 8.4
```



Now, if you change the `self` argument in this `double()` method to `self: Vec3`, like in the
`distance()` method, you will get the compiler error exposed below as result. Notice that this
error message is indicating a line from the `double()` method body,
indicating that you cannot alter the value of the `x` data member.

```zig
// If we change the function signature of double to:
    pub fn double(self: Vec3) void {
```

This error message indicates that the `x` data member belongs to a constant object,
and, because of that, it cannot be changed. Ultimately, this error message
is telling us that the `self` argument is constant.

```
t.zig:16:13: error: cannot assign to constant
        self.x = self.x * 2.0;
        ~~~~^~
```

If you take some time, and think hard about this error message, you will understand it.
You already have the tools to understand why we are getting this error message.
We have talked about it already at @sec-fun-pars.
So remember, every function argument is immutable in Zig, and `self`
is included in this rule.

It does not matter if the object that you pass as input to the function argument is
a variable object or not. In this example, we marked the `v3` object as a variable object.
But this does not matter. Because it is not about the input object, it is about
the function argument.

The problem begins when we try to alter the value of `self` directly, which is a function argument,
and, every function argument is immutable by default. You may quest yourself how can we overcome
this barrier, and once again, the solution was also discussed at @sec-fun-pars.
We overcome this barrier, by explicitly marking the `self` argument as a pointer.


::: {.callout-note}
If a method of your `x` struct alters the state of the object, by
changing the value of any data member, then, remember to use `self: *x`,
instead of `self: x` in the function signature of this method.
:::


You could also interpret the content discussed in this section as:
"if you need to alter the state of your `x` struct object in one of it's methods,
you must explicitly pass the `x` struct object by reference to the `self` argument of this method".



## Type inference {#sec-type-inference}

Zig is kind of a strongly typed language. I say "kind of" because there are situations
where you don't have to explicitly write the type of every single object in your source code,
as you would expect from a traditional strongly typed language, such as C and C++.

In some situations, the `zig` compiler can use type inference to solves the data types for you, easing some of
the burden that you carry as a developer.
The most commom way this happens is through function arguments that receives struct objects
as input.

In general, type inference in Zig is done by using the dot character (`.`).
Everytime you see a dot character written before a struct literal, or before a enum value, or something like that,
you know that this dot character is playing a special party in this place. More specifically, it is
telling the `zig` compiler something on the lines of: "Hey! Can you infer the type of this
value for me? Please!". In other words, this dot character is playing a role similar to the `auto` keyword in C++.

I give you some examples of this at @sec-anonymous-struct-literals, where we present anonymous struct literals.
Anonymous struct literals are, essentially, struct literals that use type inference to
infer the exact type of this particular struct literal.
This type inference is done by looking for some minimal hint of the correct data type to be used.
You could say that the `zig` compiler looks for any neighbouring type annotation that might tell him
what would be the correct type.

Another commom place where we use type inference in Zig is at switch statements (which we talk about at @sec-switch).
So I also gave some other examples of type inference at @sec-switch, where we were inferring the data types of enum values listed inside
of switch statements (e.g. `.DE`).
But as another example, take a look at this `fence()` function reproduced below,
which comes from the [`atomic.zig` module](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/atomic.zig)[^fence-fn]
of the Zig Standard Library.

[^fence-fn]: <https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/atomic.zig>.

There are a lot of things in this function that we haven't talked about yet, such as:
what `comptime` means? `inline`? `extern`? What is this star symbol before `Self`?
Let's just ignore all of these things, and focus solely on the switch statement
that is inside this function.

We can see that this switch statement uses the `order` object as input. This `order`
object is one of the inputs of this `fence()` function, and we can see in the type annotation,
that this object is of type `AtomicOrder`. We can also see a bunch of values inside the
switch statements that begins with a dot character, such as `.release` and `.acquire`.

Because these weird values contain a dot character before them, we are asking the `zig`
compiler to infer the types of these values inside the switch statement. Then, the `zig`
compiler is looking into the current context where these values are being used, and it is
trying to infer the types of these values.

Since they are being used inside a switch statement, the `zig` compiler looks into the type
of the input object given to the switch statement, which is the `order` object in this case.
Because this object have type `AtomicOrder`, the `zig` compiler infers that these values
are data members from this type `AtomicOrder`.

```{zig}
#| eval: false
pub inline fn fence(self: *Self, comptime order: AtomicOrder) void {
    // LLVM's ThreadSanitizer doesn't support the normal fences so we specialize for it.
    if (builtin.sanitize_thread) {
        const tsan = struct {
            extern "c" fn __tsan_acquire(addr: *anyopaque) void;
            extern "c" fn __tsan_release(addr: *anyopaque) void;
        };

        const addr: *anyopaque = self;
        return switch (order) {
            .unordered, .monotonic => @compileError(@tagName(order) ++ " only applies to atomic loads and stores"),
            .acquire => tsan.__tsan_acquire(addr),
            .release => tsan.__tsan_release(addr),
            .acq_rel, .seq_cst => {
                tsan.__tsan_acquire(addr);
                tsan.__tsan_release(addr);
            },
        };
    }

    return @fence(order);
}
```

This is how basic type inference is done in Zig. If we didn't use the dot character before
the values inside this switch statement, then, we would be forced to write explicitly
the data types of these values. For example, instead of writing `.release` we would have to
write `AtomicOrder.release`. We would have to do this for every single value
in this switch statement, and this is a lot of work. That is why type inference
is commonly used on switch statements in Zig.



## Modules

We already talked about what modules are, and also, how to import other modules into
you current module through *import statements*, so that you can use functionality from these other modules in
your current module.
But in this section, I just want to make it clear that modules are actually structs in Zig.

In other words, every Zig module (i.e. a `.zig` file) that you write in your project
is internally stored as a struct object.
Take the line exposed below as an example. In this line we are importing the
Zig Standard Library into our current module.

```zig
const std = @import("std");
```

When we want to access the functions and objects from the standard library, we
are basically accessing the data members of the struct stored in the `std`
object. That is why we use the same syntax that we use in normal structs, with the dot operator (`.`)
to access the data members and methods of the struct.

When this "import statement" get's executed, the result of this expression is a struct
object that contains the Zig Standard Library modules, global variables, functions, etc.
And this struct object get's saved (or stored) inside the constant object named `std`.


Take the [`thread_pool.zig` module from the project `zap`](https://github.com/kprotty/zap/blob/blog/src/thread_pool.zig)[^thread]
as an example. This module is written as if it was
a big struct. That is why we have a top-level and public `init()` method
written in this module. The idea is that all top-level functions written in this
module are methods from the struct, and all top-level objects and struct declarations
are data members of this struct. The module is the struct itself.

[^thread]: <https://github.com/kprotty/zap/blob/blog/src/thread_pool.zig>


So you would import and use this module by doing something like this:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const ThreadPool = @import("thread_pool.zig");
const num_cpus = std.Thread.getCpuCount()
    catch @panic("failed to get cpu core count");
const num_threads = std.math.cast(u16, num_cpus)
    catch std.math.maxInt(u16);
const pool = ThreadPool.init(
    .{ .max_threads = num_threads }
);
```



## Type casting {#sec-type-cast}

In this section, I want to discuss type casting (or, type conversion) with you.
We use type casting when we have an object of type "x", and we want to convert
it into an object of type "y", i.e. we want to change the data type of the object.

Most languages have a formal way to perform type casting. In Rust for example, we normally
use the keyword `as`, and in C, we normally use the type casting syntax, e.g. `(int) x`.
In Zig, we use the `@as()` built-in function to cast an object of type "x", into
an object of type "y".

This `@as()` function is the preferred way to perform type conversion (or type casting)
in Zig. Because it is explicit, and, it also performs the casting only if it
is unambiguous and safe. To use this function, you just provide the target data type
in the first argument, and, the object that you want cast at the second argument.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "test"
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;
test {
    const x: usize = 500;
    const y = @as(u32, x);
    try expect(@TypeOf(y) == u32);
}
```

This is the general way to perform type casting in Zig. But remember, `@as()` is used only when casting
is unambiguous and safe, and there are situations where these assumptions do not hold. For example,
when casting an integer value into a float value, or vice-versa. In a situation like this,
it is not clear to the compiler how to perform this conversion.

Therefore, we need to use specialized "casting functions" in such situations.
For example, if you want to cast an integer value into a float value, then, you
should use the `@floatFromInt()` function. In the inverse scenario, you should use
the `@intFromFloat()` function.

In these functions, you just provide the object that you want to
cast as input. Then, the target data type of the "type casting operation" is determined by
the type annotation of the object where you are saving the results.
In the example below, we are casting the object `x` into a value of type `f32`,
because the object `y`, which is where we are saving the results, is annotated
as an object of type `f32`.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "test"
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;
test {
    const x: usize = 565;
    const y: f32 = @floatFromInt(x);
    try expect(@TypeOf(y) == f32);
}
```

Another built-in function that is very useful when performing type casting operation is `@ptrCast()`.
In essence, we use the `@as()` built-in function when we want to explicit convert (or cast) a Zig value/object
from a type "x" to a type "y", etc. However, pointers (we are going to discuss pointers
in more depth at @sec-pointer) are kind of a special type of object in Zig.
In other words, pointers are treated differently from "normal objects".

Therefore, everytime you need to cast a pointer object from type "x" to type "y", you have to use the `@ptrCast()`
function. So, everytime a pointer is involved in some "type casting operation" in Zig, the `@ptrCast()` function is involved.
You just provide the pointer object that you want to cast as input to this function, and the
target data type is, once again, determined by the type annotation of the object where the results are being
stored.

```{zig}
#| auto_main: false
#| build_type: "test"
const std = @import("std");
const expect = std.testing.expect;
test {
    const bytes align(@alignOf(u32)) = [_]u8{
        0x12, 0x12, 0x12, 0x12
    };
    const u32_ptr: *const u32 = @ptrCast(&bytes);
    try expect(@TypeOf(u32_ptr) == *const u32);
}
```
