# Building a grayscale image filter

In this chapter, I want to build a stupid image filter with you, like the ones you have in Instagram or Photoshop.
The image filter we are going to implement here, is a grayscale filter. The basic idea is to
receive an input image and transform it into a grayscale image.

In this chapter, hopefully, I'm going to teach about vectors in Zig, and also,
about using C libraries.
