    "text": "About this book\nThis an open (i.e., open-source), technical and introductory book for the Zig programming language, which is a new general purpose, and low-level programming language for building optimal and robust software.\nOfficial repository of the book: https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book.\nThis book is designed for both beginners and experienced developers. It explores the exciting world of Zig through small and simple projects (in a similar style to the famous “Python Crash Course” book from Eric Matthes). Some of these projects are: a Base64 encoder/decoder, a HTTP Server and an image filter.\nAs you work through the book, you will learn:\n\nThe syntax of the language, and how it compares to C, C++ and Rust.\nData structures, memory allocators, filesystem and I/O.\nOptionals as a new paradigm to handle nullability.\nHow to test and debug a Zig application.\nErrors as values, and how to handle them.\nHow to build C and Zig code with the build system that is embedded into the language.\nZig interoperability with C.\nParallelism with threads and SIMD.\nAnd more.",
