# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome! This is the initial page for the "Open Access" HTML version of the book "Introduction to Zig: a project-based book",
written by [Pedro Duarte Faria](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/).
This is an open book that provides an introduction to the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/),
which is a new general-purpose, and low-level language for building robust and optimal software.

## Support the project! {.unnumbered}

If you like this project, and you want to support it, you can buy an eBook or a physical copy
of the book on Amazon:

{{< include ./Assets/button.html >}}

But you can also donate some amount directly to the author of the project via PayPal Donation:

{{< include ./Assets/paypal-button.html >}}

These are good ways to support directly the author of the project, which helps to foster
more contents like this, and it makes possible for the author to keep writing helpful tools and
materials for the community.

## About this book {.unnumbered}

This an open (i.e. it is open-source), technical and introductory book for the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/),
which is a new general purpose, and low-level programming language for building optimal and robust software.

Official repository of the book: <https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book>.

This book is designed for both beginners and experienced developers. It explores the exciting world of Zig through small
and simple projects (in a similar style to the famous "Python Crash Course" book from Eric Matthes).
Some of these projects are: a Base64 encoder/decoder, a HTTP Server and an image filter.

As you work through the book, you will learn:

- The syntax of the language, and how it compares to C, C++ and Rust.
- Data structures, memory allocators, filesystem and I/O.
- Optionals as a new paradigm to handle nullability.
- How to test and debug a Zig application.
- Errors as values, and how to handle them.
- How to build C and Zig code with the build system that is embedded into the language.
- Zig interoperability with C.
- Parallelism with threads and SIMD.
- And more.

The author have more than 4 years of experience in the data industry. Developing data products, pipelines,
reports and analysis for research institutions and some of the largest companies in the
brazilian financial sector, such as the BMG Bank, Sodexo and Pan Bank.

But Pedro is also a passionate software developer that loves to
learn and teach about programming.
Although Pedro uses many different languages in his work, he is specialized in the R programming language, and have given several
lectures and courses about it, inside graduate centers (such as PPEA-UFOP^[<https://ppea.ufop.br/>]),
in addition to federal and state organizations (such as FJP-MG^[<http://fjp.mg.gov.br/>]).

## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

This book is also a product of many conversations and exchanges that we had
with different people from the Zig community. I (Pedro Duarte Faria) am incredibly
grateful for these conversations, and also, for some direct contributions that we
had. Below we have a list of the people involved (name of the person with their usename in GitHub):

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: "asis"
c <- read.csv("contributors.txt")
n <- nrow(c)
user_names <- sprintf("(%s)", c$user_name)
user_names <- gsub("@", "\\\\@", user_names)
vec <- vector("character", n)
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    vec[i] <- paste(c$name[i], user_names[i])
}
cat(paste(vec, collapse = ", "), sep = "\n")
```
